/**
 * shard-pool.ts — run a fixture runner's own modules as parallel child processes.
 *
 * Shared by validation/repository/run-validator-fixtures.ts (18 domain modules) and
 * verification/fixtures/run.ts (auto-discovered suites). Both runners execute hundreds of
 * one-at-a-time spawnSync tsx children, and ~0.35s of per-process boot — not validator work —
 * made them the audit's whole critical path (launchbench ~249s, test:fixtures ~77s of a ~360s
 * audit). Individual fixture executions can NOT be pooled: modules reuse and mutate fixture
 * roots between runs, so the module/suite is the isolation boundary. Each shard is therefore
 * the runner re-spawning itself for exactly one module; inside a shard nothing changes.
 *
 * The result contract is the load-bearing part. A shard prints its results as JSON on a single
 * marker line (SHARD_RESULT_MARKER); the parent parses that line and reports every result in
 * registration order, so the combined report keeps the exact shape of the serial run. A shard
 * that dies without printing the marker MUST surface as a failure in the combined report —
 * anything else is a silent audit-pass-on-failure — which is why parseShardOutput returns
 * `results: undefined` (distinct from an empty array) for the caller to convert into a FAIL row.
