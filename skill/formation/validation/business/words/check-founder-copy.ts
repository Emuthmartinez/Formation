/**
 * check-founder-copy.ts — no raw machine value reaches a founder.
 *
 * This gate exists because the founder-facing dashboard used to print
 * state/PROJECT_STATE.yaml keys straight into HTML, so a founder read rows like
 * "paid_tool_routing | not_started" on their own business dashboard. The fix was a
 * translation layer (tooling/lib/founder-copy.ts). This gate is what stops the fix from
 * rotting the next time someone adds a lane, a status, a phase, or a provider route.
 *
 * Four rules:
 *
 * 1. COVERAGE. Every lane, status, phase, and autonomy mode in lib/launch-state.ts has
 *    founder copy in lib/founder-copy.ts. A new lane cannot ship unlabeled.
 * 2. NO RAW IDENTIFIERS. No snake_case token, SCREAMING_SNAKE token, or pipe-delimited
 *    multi-segment value appears in founder-visible text. Text inside a clearly marked
 *    technical-details disclosure is exempt, because that block is explicitly for
 *    whoever picks the repo up next rather than for the founder.
 * 3. NO INTERNAL VOCABULARY. The words in bannedFounderVocabulary do not appear in
 *    founder-visible prose. Each one has a plain-language replacement recorded next to
 *    it, so a failure tells the author what to say instead.
 * 4. THE EXPERIENCE-CARD NAMES ARE NOT TRANSLATED. Rules 1–3 all push toward inventing a
 *    friendlier word; for the twelve technique names that would be wrong, and rule 4 is
 *    the record of that decision. It holds the umbrella phrase in the lane blurb a
 *    founder reads, keeps the HIGH-risk set the founder attests to tied to the tiers the
 *    card stubs declare, and rejects any attempt to ban a technique name outright.
 *
 * Scanning is deliberately text-only: HTML attributes (where `class="status
 * not_started"` legitimately carries the enum), <style> and <script> bodies, markdown
 * code fences, and inline code spans are stripped before the scan. Identifiers belong in
 * those places; they do not belong in a sentence a founder reads.
 *
 * npm script: check:founder-copy
 * Usage: tsx validation/business/words/check-founder-copy.ts --root /path/to/templates [--skill-root /path/to/skill]
