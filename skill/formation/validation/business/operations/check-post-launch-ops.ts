/**
 * check-post-launch-ops
 *
 * Enforces the Post-Launch Operations contract: a launched app is a live
 * business, and "launched" is not the end state of the launch package. When
 * the post_launch_ops lane is claimed (partial/done) or the project reaches
 * the post-launch phases (phase_6/phase_6b), this validator requires:
 *   1. operations/POST_LAUNCH_OPS.md to exist (the operating runbook).
 *   2. The runbook to carry the operating sections: Weekly Operating Rhythm,
 *      Crash Triage, Review Responses, Release And Hotfix Cadence,
 *      Retention Review, Support Operations, Launch Retro.
 *   3. done additionally requires: a named crash route (Sentry or store crash
 *      reports), a stated review-response SLA, a retention cohort source, and
 *      operations/LAUNCH_RETRO.md on disk so the retro loop feeds failure cards.
 *   4. The numbers loop: lanes.post_launch_ops.live_since anchors the clock;
 *      day-30/day-90 retro checkpoints cannot sit uncompleted past their due
 *      date, evidence cells cannot hold placeholder text ("unverified — confirm
 *      in RevenueCat"), and the weekly log must carry dated rows with real
 *      numbers once the app has been live past two weeks. A recorded Kill
 *      verdict is the one legitimate way for the rhythm to go quiet.
 *
 * Launch-and-vanish — shipping the store release with no operating rhythm —
 * is the failure this catches. See knowledge/operations/post-launch-operations.md.
 *
 * Run:
 *   npm run check:post-launch -- --root <app-repo-root>
