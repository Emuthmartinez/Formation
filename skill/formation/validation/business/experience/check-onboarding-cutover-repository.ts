/**
 * Independent, repository-grounded check for ONB-22's Zero-Legacy Cutover / Deletion Manifest.
 *
 * check-onboarding-graph.ts (and its --require-done wrapper, ONB-22's other gate) only ever
 * inspects product/ONBOARDING.md's own self-authored text -- it has no way to notice a Deletion
 * Manifest row that claims a legacy artifact was deleted while that artifact still sits on disk.
 * The executor's own record cannot be its own verification for a destructive, one-time cutover:
 * this check reads the Deletion Manifest table and, for every row whose Disposition claims
 * "delete," verifies the claim against actual filesystem state, exactly the way
 * check-live-provider-proof.ts already grounds provider-readiness claims in real evidence paths
 * rather than trusting prose.
