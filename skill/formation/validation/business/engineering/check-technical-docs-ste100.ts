/**
 * check-technical-docs-ste100.ts — the mechanically checkable subset of ASD-STE100.
 *
 * knowledge/engineering/technical-documentation-ste100.md names two rules a machine can
 * verify without judgment: sentence length and present-perfect tense. Everything else in
 * its §3 (one word per meaning, active voice, noun-cluster length) stays judgment-only, the
 * same limit tooling/lib/no-slop-rules.ts documents for the sibling standard — a regex would
 * punish good writing as often as it catches bad writing.
 *
 * Two severity tiers, mirroring check-no-slop.ts's own front-door split: error tier applies
 * only to files this reference can currently guarantee compliant (today, just the reference
 * itself); warning tier applies to the rest of the governed surface — docs/architecture.md,
 * docs/validators.md, and every knowledge/**\/*.md file outside knowledge/words/ (which keeps
 * no-slop-writing.md's voice-preserving register instead). This gives real, repo-wide signal
 * on every edit without failing the build over prose written before this standard existed.
 * Promoting a file to error tier means auditing it against the reference's §3/§4 first, then
 * adding its skill-root-relative path to ERROR_TIER_SKILL_RELATIVE below.
 *
 * npm script: check:documentation-ste100
 * Usage: tsx validation/business/engineering/check-technical-docs-ste100.ts [--repo-root /path] [--skill-root /path]
