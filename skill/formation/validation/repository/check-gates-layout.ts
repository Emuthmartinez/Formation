/**
 * check-gates-layout.ts — the validation/business/ tree defends its own shape.
 *
 * docs/architecture.md settled two rules when the validators split in v0.55.0:
 * `validation/business/` mirrors the playbook domains, and there is no top-level exception
 * bucket — a genuinely cross-cutting gate goes to `validation/business/process/`. Nothing
 * enforced either. A new gate filed under the wrong domain, or dropped at
 * `validation/business/` root, was invisible to every other check.
 *
 * The duplicate-basename rule is the one that actually regressed. A FLAT
 * `validation/business/` made two files with the same name structurally impossible — one
 * directory cannot hold them. Mirroring bought browsability and gave that
 * guarantee up: nothing stops `validation/business/money/check-revenue.ts` and
 * `validation/business/growth/check-revenue.ts` both existing after a bad merge. Callers
 * address scripts by basename alone, so a collision is not cosmetic — it makes
 * `resolveScriptPath` ambiguous, and every fixture that spawns by basename
 * starts resolving to whichever file the walk happened to reach first.
 * `indexScripts` already throws on it, but only at spawn time, which is a
 * backstop rather than a gate.
 *
 * The domain list is read from `knowledge/` rather than hardcoded, so the two
 * trees cannot drift: adding a playbook domain automatically permits the
 * matching gates folder, and deleting one immediately flags its orphaned gates.
 *
 * npm script: check:gates-layout
 * Usage: tsx validation/repository/check-gates-layout.ts --skill-root /path/to/skill
