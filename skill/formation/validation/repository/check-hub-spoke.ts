/**
 * check-hub-spoke.ts — bidirectional hub<->spoke routing integrity.
 *
 * Established pattern (tool-recipes.md, experience-cards.md, revenue-monetization.md):
 * a hub file carries decision/routing content, and each spoke file carries setup or
 * procedure detail and opens with a "Part of the [Hub](path)" backlink. audit-skill-links.ts
 * already catches a dangling link target and a file nothing mentions at all;
 * check-reference-size.ts already catches a knowledge/ file the generated routing index
 * can't reach. Neither catches a spoke that claims membership in a hub the hub itself does
 * not route back to -- the exact "content got restated instead of pointed-to, and the two
 * copies silently diverged" shape the 2026-08 graph-consolidation audit found in
 * revenue-monetization.md's original monolith. A spoke not listed in its own hub's routing
 * is invisible to anyone reading the hub top-down, even if some other file happens to link it.
 *
 * npm script: check:hub-spoke
 * Usage: tsx validation/repository/check-hub-spoke.ts --skill-root /path/to/skill
