/**
 * Structural proof of the task's "your module READS control/grants/waivers/ledger docs, never
 * writes them" boundary (KTD7: mutation is reachable only through the reducer CLI's typed-patch
 * interface). This is not a behavioral test of any one function — it is a source-level guarantee
 * that core/autonomy/**​/*.ts never even imports a disk-mutating primitive, so no future change to
 * any function in this unit can silently start writing without also failing this check. The scan
 * is recursive so subdirectories (e.g. probes/) are covered, not just autonomyDir's own top-level
 * files.
 *
 * HONEST LIMITATION: this is a structural smoke check, not a proof of "cannot write to disk". It
 * greps each file's own source text for a fixed list of Node fs write-primitive names. It catches
 * a direct `writeFileSync(...)`-shaped call added straight into this tree. It does NOT catch a
 * write reached indirectly — e.g. a module here importing and calling a writer function defined
 * in another file (that helper need not have a "write-shaped" name at all), a write performed via
 * a passed-in callback, or one reached through reflection/dynamic property access. A pass here
 * means "no obvious direct write primitive was referenced in this file's own source", not "this
 * code is provably incapable of writing to disk".
