/**
 * Ports LaunchBench scenario `secret-routing-missing.yaml` (validators cited there:
 * check-secret-routing [port-disposition: keep], validate-project-state [keep] — both survive
 * unchanged, still scanning generated business workspaces). The gap this scenario closes: neither
 * validator's `--root` ever points at the skill's OWN new source tree (core/, catalog/, content/,
 * verification/) — `check-secret-routing.ts` only ever scans a generated business's
 * `workspace/business/` tree. The new greenfield core is real, hand-authored code too, and could
 * just as easily hardcode a live-looking secret; nothing was checking that before this scenario.
 *
 * Reuses the exact `secretLike` pattern from
 * validation/business/trust/check-secret-routing.ts (not re-derived — the same literal, so the
 * two scans agree on what "looks like a secret" means) rather than inventing a second, divergent
 * regex (this repo's own recorded "duplicated helpers have already diverged" lesson).
