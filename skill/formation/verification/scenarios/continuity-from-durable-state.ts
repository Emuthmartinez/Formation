/**
 * Ports LaunchBench scenario `continuity-drift-between-sessions.yaml` (validators cited there:
 * check-continuity-contract [port-disposition: port], check-agent-entrypoints [drop],
 * check-workflow-adherence [drop] — the port ledger). The YAML's own must_catch item is R1 in
 * plain language: "chat memory was treated as source truth instead of durable repo files."
 *
 * R1 says a session — interactive or scheduled, any runtime — "reconstructs truth from durable
 * state, never from chat memory." The strongest mechanical proof of that isn't an in-process
 * assertion (engine.fixtures.ts's "mid-launch seeding excludes completed work" already covers the
 * in-process half): it's two REAL, separate OS processes sharing nothing but the filesystem. This
 * check runs core/session/run.ts twice, back to back, each as its own `spawnSync` child — there is
 * no JS heap, no closure, no chat transcript a second process could reach into even if it wanted
 * to. If session 2 correctly treats session 1's work as done, that fact came from
 * run/run-state.json and state/business-state.json on disk, because there is nothing else it could
 * have come from.
