/**
 * Ported from runtime/graph/operators.ts + runtime/graph/define.ts's defineOperators()
 * (deleted at cutover, U11 — KTD11 "dead engine code superseded by v2"). defineOperators()
 * was an identity function carrying only a generic-const type constraint; that constraint is
 * inlined here as a direct `as const` annotation, matching every other catalog/*.ts module's
 * convention (catalog/lanes.ts, catalog/phases.ts).
 *
 * Not part of the v2 Catalog shape composeCatalog() returns — no v2 consumer needs the full
 * operator roster except tooling/render-business-control-plane-workspace.ts, which reads
 * four of these (`operator.orchestrator`, `operator.product-leader`, `operator.design-guru`,
 * `operator.engineering-leader`) by id for the Business Control Plane's Agent Lanes panel.
 * The full roster remains available for parity checks and tooling. Its `contextPackIds` now point
 * to executable catalog/context-packs.ts definitions, and every prepared agent prompt has both a
 * CatalogRole and CatalogOperator record with a live `promptPath` under
 * workspace/business/engineering/app-agent-roster/agents/ — dropping them would be a content
 * loss with no v2 consumer requiring it, not a cull the ledger or KTD11 calls for.
