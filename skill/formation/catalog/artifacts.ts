 * Artifacts are derived from workflow outputPaths, not hand-authored — one entry per
 * distinct output path across the catalog. Ported in spirit from
 * runtime/graph/graph.ts's artifact-merging loop, but simpler: v1 also discovered
 * artifacts from `workspace/business/state/PROJECT_STATE.yaml` lane evidence (a second,
 * looser source of artifact identity that tolerated the same path being claimed by more
 * than one workflow — see catalog/workflows/*.ts headers for the collisions that produced
 * in this rebuild). v2 has one derived source for produced artifacts: each output path has
 * exactly one producing workflow. The sole explicit exception is the session-observed app
 * source fingerprint. It is an external graph input so source edits can stale consumers before
 * the frontier is computed.
