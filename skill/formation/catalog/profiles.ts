/**
 * Named launch profiles (layering plan phase E, requirement R7): the engine-enforced half of
 * what knowledge/process/launch-phases.md "Launch Scopes" has said in prose since v0.28.0.
 *
 * Before this registry existed, `project.launch_scope` had NO behavioral consumer in the typed
 * engine — compile, frontier, and run-state never read it, so an "essentials" business relied
 * entirely on an agent hand-marking lanes deferred (2026-08-20 finding). A profile turns the
 * scope value into compiled fact: a workflow whose every lane sits in the profile's deferred
 * set parks as not_needed at seed time and at every frontier pass, through the SAME
 * reconcileWorkflowApplicability path scope verdicts already use — same invalidation on change,
 * same founder override (a recorded "required" verdict beats the profile), same audit trail.
 *
 * Granularity is deliberate: lanes, not the prose's finer clauses. The prose defers "lifecycle
 * email beyond transactional" — the engine defers the email LANE, and the finer judgment stays
 * with the dated-reason deferral mechanics check:lane-coverage already polices. The engine
 * enforces the floor; prose still guides the rest.
 *
 * NEVER_DEFERRED_LANES is the launch-phases.md rule made mechanical: an essentials launch still
 * charges money, handles data, and passes review. validateCatalog fails any profile that defers
 * one of these.
 *
 * The v1 validators (validate-project-state.ts) keep their two-value vocabulary on purpose —
 * every v1 workspace only ever recorded "essentials"/"full"/legacy "lite". New profile ids are a
 * v2-native concern; they reach a workspace only through bootstrap against an engine that knows
 * them.
