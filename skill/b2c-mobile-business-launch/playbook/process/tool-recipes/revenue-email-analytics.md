# Revenue, Email, And Analytics Routing

Use current tools and live data whenever possible. Treat this file as workflow, not fixed facts.

## Revenue And Monetization Routing

Purpose: set up purchase infrastructure without confusing payment success with app entitlement access.

Use `revenue-monetization.md` as the router. Delegate to local skills when available:
- `setup-revenuecat` for initial RevenueCat project, `premium` entitlement, and default offering scaffold.
- `stripe-best-practices` before Stripe Checkout, Payment Links, Billing, Customer Portal, webhooks, or tax decisions.
- ASO `monetization-strategy`, `subscription-lifecycle`, and `retention-optimization` for pricing, paywall timing, churn, and lifecycle loops.
- `setup-posthog` once the product repo exists and purchase/subscription events need validation.
- `setup-supabase` if the funnel or backend needs accounts, waitlist, referrals, or subscription projection storage.
- `resend-email-ops.md` before subscription lifecycle emails, payment recovery, receipts, trial reminders, or billing-support notifications.

Rules:
- RevenueCat should be the entitlement source of truth for B2C mobile subscriptions unless the project explicitly chooses a different architecture.
- Stripe may process web payments, but web payment success must be mapped into RevenueCat entitlement or backend access before launch-ready.
- App Store/Google Play product setup, web billing, pricing, taxes, subscription terms, and live checkout are founder-only gates.
- Use sandbox/Test Store first; do not publish production purchase links or live prices until validation passes and the founder approves.
- RevenueCat, Stripe, tax, and store-account features can be paid/account-gated. Use `paid-tool-routing.md` before replacing provider setup with local mocks or free-tier planning, and never call mocks live entitlement proof.

### Recipe: RevenueCat Economics Pull

Purpose: get the revenue numbers out of the dashboard and into decisions on a fixed cadence — the offering/entitlement probe (`probe:revenuecat`) proves the plumbing works, this recipe reads what flows through it. Run it before every kill-or-scale checkpoint (`post-launch-operations.md` §9) and each Weekly Ops Review growth step once spend is active.

1. Refresh the current RevenueCat charts/metrics docs from the §1 sources in `revenue-monetization.md` before relying on chart names or API shapes — dashboards and endpoints move; record the docs basis and checked date with the numbers.
2. Pull four numbers for the trailing window: MRR, realized LTV per paying customer, download-to-paid (initial) conversion, and churn split voluntary vs. involuntary by platform (the §8a events make the split readable in PostHog when RevenueCat's own view is too coarse).
3. Land them in the `revenue/REVENUE_OPS.md` Economics Snapshot row for the date, with the source named per row.
4. Route the consequences, not just the numbers: LTV and payback feed the `growth/PAID_UA.md` blended report and its Decision Thresholds; the cancellation-reason mix feeds the Pricing Decision revisit (§7a step 5); the whole row feeds the kill-or-scale evidence pack.
5. Numbers that would change a founder-gated decision (price, spend, kill/scale) get surfaced in the reply per the narration contract — never only written to the file.

## Resend Email Routing

Purpose: set up outbound, lifecycle, broadcast, and optional inbound email without damaging domain reputation or creating compliance gaps.

Use `resend-email-ops.md` before:
- Resend domain creation or DNS changes
- transactional email send wrappers
- waitlist confirmations, welcome messages, trial reminders, payment recovery, receipts, support confirmations, or admin alerts
- Contacts, Topics, Segments, Broadcasts, or Automations
- unsubscribe/preference handling
- Resend webhooks, inbound receiving, or attachment processing

Rules:
- Prefer a verified sending subdomain over the root domain.
- Keep Resend API keys server-side only; never use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` or browser bundles.
- Prefer sending-access/domain-scoped keys for runtime senders.
- Use idempotency keys for retryable transactional sends.
- Verify webhooks with the raw request body and store `svix-id` to handle duplicates.
- Add unsubscribe/preference handling for lifecycle and marketing email.
- Treat inbound MX changes as founder-gated when they could affect existing mailboxes or Cloudflare Email Routing.
- Resend account/domain features can be paid/account-gated. Use `paid-tool-routing.md` before replacing Resend with local email previews, logs, Gmail, Cloudflare Email Routing, or another provider.

## PostHog Analytics And Attribution Routing

Purpose: make analytics, attribution, and launch learning visible before implementation and then validate the first real events once a repo exists.

Use `analytics-attribution.md` before:
- PostHog setup or SDK installation
- event catalogs, funnels, dashboards, or PostHog project decisions
- landing/waitlist/referral analytics
- onboarding attribution questions
- paywall, trial, closing-offer, or RevenueCat/Stripe event naming
- feature flags, experiments, session replay, surveys, or data pipelines
- Fastlane/social campaign UTM conventions
- builder prompts that ask another agent to implement events

Delegate:
- `setup-posthog` only after the product repo exists and can receive an event scaffold.
- `setup-posthog` handles initial project/setup validation; this launch skill owns the upfront `analytics/ANALYTICS.md` and `analytics/analytics-plan.html`.
- Use current PostHog docs or Context7/web docs for stack-specific SDK details because PostHog SDK options, defaults, and product docs change.

Default stack:
- PostHog primary for product analytics, web analytics, feature flags, funnels, session replay when explicitly enabled, surveys, and experiments.
- RevenueCat as subscription entitlement truth and subscription event source.
- Stripe as web payment truth when direct checkout exists.
- GA4/ad-network tooling only when paid ads, Google attribution, or platform reporting require it.
- Sentry for errors/crashes, not product analytics.

Rules:
- Create `analytics/ANALYTICS.md` and a founder-visible `analytics/analytics-plan.html` before implementation.
- Track waitlist, referral, pricing-section, app-store CTA, onboarding steps, attribution answer, demo video, personalized plan, review prompt eligibility/request, paywall view/dismissal, closing offer, activation, subscription lifecycle, restore, refund, email lifecycle, and Fastlane campaign events when relevant.
- Combine technical attribution with self-reported attribution; UTMs alone miss word-of-mouth, creator, AI-search, and social discovery.
- Use one analytics wrapper per surface; do not scatter vendor SDK calls throughout app code.
- Validate at least one real event in the dashboard before saying analytics is live.
- Do not enable replay, surveys, ad identifiers, or sensitive event properties without privacy/store-disclosure mapping.
- PostHog paid/account features can affect replay, surveys, experiments, retention, and data pipelines. Use `paid-tool-routing.md` before replacing them with static plans or local event logs.
