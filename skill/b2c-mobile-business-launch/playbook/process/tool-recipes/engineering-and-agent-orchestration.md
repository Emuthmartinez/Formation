## Compound Engineering And Agent Orchestration

Purpose: turn the launch package into production-ready software without losing product, design, analytics, entitlement, or testing truth.

Use `engineering-orchestration.md` before:
- actual app, backend, or web-funnel implementation
- builder/Rork/Codex/Claude handoff prompts that will create app code
- `ORCHESTRATION.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `LAUNCH_TRACE.md`, `TECH_SPEC.md`, `ENGINEERING_PLAN.md`, or `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`
- deciding whether to use product brainstorm, planning, parallel agents, or worktrees
- declaring beta, store-submission, or production readiness

Load `compound-engineering-routing.md` before core engineering. It is the enforceable CE route and state contract; this section is the quick recipe.

Use `parallel-agent-orchestration.md` before any subagent dispatch or multi-lane launch run. The default runtime habit should be: keep the critical path local, identify safe sidecar agents, serialize shared resources, and write the preflight before claiming speed from parallelism.

Delegate:
- `ce-update` in Claude Code, or a recorded local inventory/latest-release fallback, before a substantial engineering run.
- `ce-brainstorm` after AppKittie/XPOZ/Firecrawl research when product shape, onboarding, paywall, core loop, activation, or scope still has multiple defensible directions.
- `ce-plan` when launch docs are stable enough to become an implementation plan.
- `ce-work` for bounded execution from a concrete plan.
- `ce-worktree` for isolated parallel engineering lanes, PR review, or keeping a dirty main checkout safe.
- `ce-code-review` before treating non-trivial implementation as complete.
- `ce-test-browser` for web funnels, checkout, policy pages, support flows, dashboards, and responsive browser checks.
- `ce-test-xcode` for iOS build/test verification where applicable.
- `ce-proof` or `ce-demo-reel` when the founder/reviewer needs a visual proof artifact.
- MobAI MCP or the local `using-mobai-cli` skill for serialized mobile-device E2E and store screenshot capture.
- If Compound Engineering is unavailable, record the unavailable route and equivalent fallback in `ORCHESTRATION.md`, `PROJECT_STATE.yaml`, and `ENGINEERING_PLAN.md`; do not let agents skip directly from docs to readiness.

Parallel rules:
- Parallelize research, static audits, independent docs, isolated frontend/backend units, fixtures, and test-writing only after mapping each unit to create/modify/test files.
- If two lanes touch the same file, migration state, simulator/device, git staging, release action, or final readiness decision, run them serially.
- The orchestrator owns staging, commits, merges, project-wide suites, MobAI device ownership, production-readiness judgment, and final ship/hold decisions.
- Instruct parallel subagents not to run project-wide suites, stage files, commit, merge, publish, submit, schedule content, or mutate shared credentials.
- After parallel work returns, compare modified files, resolve collisions, run focused tests, then run integration/E2E checks.

Record in `ORCHESTRATION.md` and `PROJECT_STATE.yaml`:
- CE availability, latest-version check, skills considered, selected route, and fallback reason if unavailable
- selected strategy: `not_evaluated`, `inline`, `serial_subagents`, `parallel_subagents`, `worktrees`, `hybrid`, `blocked`, or `not_needed`
- critical path kept local by the orchestrator
- candidate units, roles, objectives, modes, files, shared resources, and safety decisions
- spawned agents, forbidden actions, output paths, actual file collision check, and integration status
- focused validators and full suites run after integration

Record in `ENGINEERING_PLAN.md`:
- product brainstorm source or skip rationale
- requirements trace to `LAUNCH_TRACE.md`, `TECH_SPEC.md`, `SPEC.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `design.md`, `ANALYTICS.md`, `ONBOARDING.md`, `REVENUE_OPS.md`, `EMAIL_OPS.md`, `PRIVACY.md`, `APPLE_SIGNING.md`, and `STORE_CONSOLE.md`
- implementation units, repo-relative paths, serial dependencies, worktree needs, safe parallel lanes, serialized resources, and subagent output contracts
- frontend, backend, database, analytics, revenue, email, privacy, store-console, app-integrity, permission, and state-machine impacts
- test scenarios, MobAI E2E scenarios, backend/provider verification, release gates, and blockers

Record in `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`:
- build/typecheck/lint/test commands and outcomes for every touched repo
- browser/mobile E2E evidence, including MobAI steps and screenshots where relevant
- backend/database/provider proof for frontend actions, RevenueCat/Stripe entitlements, PostHog events, Resend sends/webhooks, and account deletion/support paths when in scope
- release-build/staging-build proof that mocks are disabled and secrets are not bundled
- remaining blockers and founder-only gates

Rules:
- `AGENTS.md` is mandatory for real app builds and builder handoffs; start from `business/repo-agent-entrypoints/AGENTS.md` so future agents keep using `b2c-mobile-business-launch` without another founder prompt. `CLAUDE.md` should start from `business/repo-agent-entrypoints/CLAUDE.md` and point back to `AGENTS.md` instead of duplicating product truth. Keep these files as maps to source docs, active plans, validators, and failure cards.
- Unit tests are not enough for production readiness.
- Screenshot proof from any device route — in-app simulator, MobAI, XcodeBuildMCP — is not backend proof; pair device actions with database/provider/dashboard evidence.
- Do not use generated builders from a prompt alone. Include repo-local instructions and artifacts so later agents can continue without reconstructing the launch logic.
