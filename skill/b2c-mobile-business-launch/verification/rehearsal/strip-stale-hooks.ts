 * Remove this skill's stale v1 managed hook entries from an existing business repo's
 * .claude/settings.json, preserving every founder-owned entry.
 *
 * The v1 hook mechanism was deleted at the v2 cutover, so its entries now point at
 * validators that no longer exist. install-entrypoints.ts also rewrites AGENTS.md /
 * CLAUDE.md from templates, which would destroy a repo's hand-authored guide — this
 * reuses only the tested strip step.
 *
 * Usage: tsx verification/rehearsal/strip-stale-hooks.ts <repo-dir> [--apply]
