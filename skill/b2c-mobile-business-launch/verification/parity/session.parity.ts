/**
 * The runtime-parity suite (R3, KTD10; Verification Contract's "Runtime parity" gate, U6/U9):
 * drives ONE fixture scenario through every capability profile — the three founder-facing
 * runtimes plus `inline` — and asserts the adapter-parity rule directly, not just structurally:
 * identical node reachability, identical approval/waiver requirements, identical parked reasons.
 * Differences may appear ONLY in concurrency (each profile's own maxConcurrency), mode, or the
 * outer command fields — never in which nodes run or why a node is parked.
 *
 * No real vendor CLI is invoked. A profile's `buildHeadlessCommand` output is the prompt an actual
 * `claude`/`codex`/`cursor-agent` process would receive telling it to run ONE fixed inner command
 * (core/adapters/profile.ts's buildFixedPrompt) — this suite runs that inner command directly,
 * `tsx core/session/run.ts ...` with `--executor fixture`, once per profile's own maxConcurrency,
 * each against its own freshly bootstrapped but content-identical workspace (same catalog, same
 * grants/waivers/balances — see runProfile's doc comment on why "identical" is achieved by
 * re-bootstrapping rather than copying). That inner invocation is exactly what adapters.fixtures.ts
 * already proves each profile's constructed command reduces to (see its "buildHeadlessCommand
 * never inlines the brief's content" case) — this suite picks up where that one stops, actually
 * running the shared session pipeline instead of only inspecting the command string, and diffs the
 * real decisions it produced.

/**
 * Bootstraps a FRESH, independent workspace per profile — deliberately not a filesystem copy of a
 * shared source. The reducer's manifest tracks each committed document by its own ABSOLUTE path
 * (core/reducer/cli.ts's `manifest.entries[filePath]`); a naive `cpSync` of a bootstrapped
 * workspace carries over a manifest keyed by the SOURCE directory's paths, so the copy's own
 * commits see "file exists on disk but is not tracked in the manifest" and reject as tampered —
 * which, for a spend node's estimate patch, never advances the node past "ready" and gets
 * re-attempted every dispatch pass until the wall-clock cap, not a fast, loud failure. (Recorded
 * the hard way: this suite's first draft hung for the full 1800s cap before this was found — see
 * the U9 completion report's "deviations" section.) Re-running the identical bootstrap sequence
 * per profile is slightly more subprocess overhead than a copy would have been, but it is byte-
 * identical in the ways that matter (same catalog, same grants/waivers/balances, same "now"
 * timestamps) and never carries a stale absolute-path manifest into a directory it doesn't match.
