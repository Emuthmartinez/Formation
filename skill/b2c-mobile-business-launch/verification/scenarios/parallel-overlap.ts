/**
 * Ports LaunchBench scenario `parallel-file-overlap-unsafe.yaml` (validator cited there:
 * check-parallel-orchestration [port-disposition: port — the file-ownership collision algorithm is
 * structural, its ORCHESTRATION.md prose-policy half is word-pattern and dropped). The structural
 * half already has a strong unit-level proof: engine.fixtures.ts's "prefix-overlapping resource
 * claims serialize" case, exercising core/engine/dispatch.ts's buildDispatchBatches directly.
 *
 * This scenario adds what that unit-level fixture cannot show on its own: that the invariant holds
 * all the way through the REAL session pipeline — compile -> frontier -> dispatch -> execute ->
 * reducer commit — for two workflows whose declared output paths overlap the exact way the
 * LaunchBench prompt describes ("two parallel agents ... update the same
 * engineering/ENGINEERING_PLAN.md"). It proves two things a batching-only check cannot: (1) the
 * two nodes still land in separate dispatch batches when actually compiled and run, not just in a
 * hand-built fixture plan, and (2) each node's own artifact binding is accepted with the fingerprint
 * of its OWN attempt — never the other's — so "these two never touch the same resource in the same
 * pass" also means "neither one's declared output can silently absorb the other's write."
