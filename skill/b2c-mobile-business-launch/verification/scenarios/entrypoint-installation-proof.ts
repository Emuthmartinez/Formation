/**
 * Ports LaunchBench scenario `business-agent-entrypoints-missing.yaml` (validator cited there:
 * check-agent-entrypoints [port-disposition: drop — word-pattern]). The YAML's mechanically
 * checkable core survives even though its cited validator does not: "Do not copy skill-maintainer
 * AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md into a generated business repo" is a real, structural, byte-comparable
 * fact, not prose grading. The subject that replaces the old validator is
 * core/adapters/install-entrypoints.ts (U6) — this suite adds the ONE assertion that file's own
 * adapters.fixtures.ts coverage stops short of: proving the installed content is not a verbatim
 * copy of the maintainer's own root-level AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md.
 *
 * `business-repo-hooks-not-installed.yaml` — the sibling scenario about the OLD PostToolUse hook
 * mechanism — is DELIBERATELY NOT ported here. KTD8/R19 delete that mechanism outright at cutover
 * (port ledger's #3 top-drop: "its entire subject ... is deleted at cutover; nothing survives to
 * port"). It stays untouched in place for U11 to delete, per this unit's own port-ledger
 * discipline: a drop-listed scenario is not this unit's to touch.
