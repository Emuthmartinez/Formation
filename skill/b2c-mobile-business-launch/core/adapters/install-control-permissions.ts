/**
 * install-control-permissions.ts — layer 3 of the autonomy trust boundary described in
 * workspace-template/repo-agent-entrypoints/AGENTS.md's "Autonomy Trust Boundary" section: OS
 * write-protection of `control/` from the agent's uid, the one layer of the three that actually
 * PREVENTS a Bash-capable scheduled session from self-granting rather than merely detecting it
 * (layer 1, the tool allowlist in core/adapters/profile.ts) or refusing it after the fact (layer
 * 2, the founder-authority gate in core/reducer/cli.ts).
 *
 * THE MECHANISM (all of it): clear the group and other write bits — `chmod go-w`, recursively —
 * on `control/` and every entry currently inside it, never touching the owner's own bits. Read and
 * execute (traversal/listing) stay intact for group/other, matching the workspace AGENTS.md's own
 * description of the agent's OS account needing "read-only access to control/". That is the exact
 * mode math this script applies: `nextMode = currentMode & ~0o022` for every directory and file
 * under `control/`, applied bottom-up.
 *
 * WHY CHMOD ALONE ISN'T THE WHOLE STORY: clearing group/other write only protects against a uid
 * that ISN'T the owner. The uid that owns `control/` can always chmod it back to writable — chmod
 * permission itself is governed by ownership, not by the current mode bits. So this script cannot,
 * by itself, know whether it just built a real boundary or a merely advisory one: that depends on
 * whether the scheduled session actually runs as a different, unprivileged OS account, which is a
 * founder OS-admin decision outside this script's authority (see NEVER below). Determining which
 * one actually resulted is deliberately NOT this file's job at install time — see
 * `verifyControlBoundary` below, which answers that empirically, and honestly, at verify/session
 * time instead of trusting what this installer merely intended.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMITATION (read before relying on this for a live grant above the lowest level):
 * `control/` currently holds BOTH the founder-only autonomy document (control.json: kill switch +
 * grants + waivers) AND the operational bookkeeping files a scheduled session legitimately writes
 * every run through the reducer (budget-ledger.json, manifest.json, audit.jsonl) plus the session
 * lock it writes directly (session.lock — core/reducer/lock.ts). A directory-level chmod cannot
 * separate "founder-only" from "session-writable" within one directory: the reducer's atomic
 * writes (write-tmp-then-rename, core/reducer/cli.ts's writeFileAtomic) need write permission on
 * the DIRECTORY, not just the target file, and so does session.lock's own acquire/heartbeat/
 * release. So a workspace where this boundary is genuinely `enforced` (a real, different
 * --agent-user session uid) will ALSO lose the scheduled session's own ability to record budget
 * spend or hold its session lock — the runtime does not yet split `control/` into a founder-only
 * document and a session-writable bookkeeping location. Naming this rather than silently working
 * around it; resolving it is a file-layout change outside this script's scope.
 *
 * NEVER: runs sudo; creates, deletes, or modifies a user account; chowns anything (this script
 * never calls chown at all — the mechanism above needs none). If applying the plan would need
 * privileges this process doesn't have, it prints the exact command the founder must run
 * themselves and exits non-zero in --apply mode, rather than attempting any workaround.
 *
 * Usage (mirrors install-entrypoints.ts / install-schedule.ts: default is a dry run):
 *   tsx core/adapters/install-control-permissions.ts --workspace <dir> [--agent-user <name>] [--apply]

 * 2. A process that OWNS control/ can always `chmod` it back to writable — chmod permission is

 *    reported as "enforced", no matter how restrictive control/'s mode looks, and no matter what

 *    regardless of mode, since this script never clears the owner's own bits). That case is
