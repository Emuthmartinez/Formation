/**
 * Resolution: manifest requirement -> present/absent, from real sources, honestly. Two hard
 * rules this file exists to hold the line on (repo lesson: never source a whole .env, never
 * print/log/return a raw credential value):
 *
 *   1. Doppler and .env resolution is PRESENCE ONLY. Every function here returns names (strings
 *      that are themselves not secret) or booleans — never a value read from either source.
 *   2. `external` requirements are never satisfied by a key/config value being present. They
 *      resolve to "unverifiable" unless a live probe (not built here — see tooling/probe-
 *      posthog.ts, tooling/probe-revenuecat.ts for the two that exist) or a recorded founder
 *      confirmation says otherwise.
 *
 * Two-tier Doppler composition (knowledge/operations/doppler-organization.md): a portfolio keeps
 * one shared account-level Doppler project (`formation`) plus one project per business. Cross-project inheritance
 * (`doppler configs update --inherits`) is a paid-tier feature, so this file composes the two
 * tiers itself rather than depending on Doppler to do it — a name present in EITHER tier's
 * lookup satisfies a requirement, with the business tier winning over the platform tier on
 * conflict (matching `doppler run -p formation ... -- doppler run -p <business> ... --`, where the
 * inner/business injection wins). Presence-only still holds across both tiers: this file never
 * reads, returns, or logs which tier's *value* would actually be used, only which tier's name
 * lookup satisfied the requirement — genuinely useful founder information ("this came from your
 * shared account-level `formation` project") that carries no secret value with it.
