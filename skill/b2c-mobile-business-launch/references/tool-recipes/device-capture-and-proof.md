## In-App Simulator, MobAI Toolbelt, Recorders, Native iOS, And CLI Simulator Capture

Purpose: capture truthful app UI for App Store and Google Play screenshots, record polished demo videos, create app-preview/social proof, and compose final assets with the design system.

Load `xcodebuildmcp-testing.md` first for any "run the app / check this screen / walk this flow / reproduce this bug" request: its Route Ladder starts at the in-app iOS Simulator (rung 0 — Claude Code Desktop's simulator pane or Codex with the `build-ios-apps` plugin), which needs no install and no account, and it also covers the CLI `computer-use` route, XcodeBuildMCP, SnapshotPreviews preview exports, serve-sim streaming, and Apple simulator/device command examples. Always load `mobai-toolbelt.md` before MobAI device automation, recorder skills, Android coverage, repeatable `.mob` suites, polished demo/app-preview recording, or MobAI-adjacent build/test tooling. Refresh the MobAI org and relevant repo docs before installing or naming commands.

Use when:
- a local iOS or Android build exists
- store screenshots need real app state
- review/rejection work depends on what a reviewer sees
- screenshot copy or layout must be verified on actual device sizes
- launch, store, Fastlane, UGC, support, or investor materials need a polished app-flow video

Preferred routing:
- For a single screen check, flow walk, or bug repro on a local Mac, use the in-app iOS Simulator (rung 0) and stop there — no MCP server, no CLI install, no founder gate.
- Use the MobAI MCP tools when exposed in the current runtime and the lane needs Android, a repeatable suite, multi-device runs, or polished demo recording.
- Before any device interaction, read the MobAI device automation reference or the local `using-mobai-cli` skill.
- Observe the UI tree before tapping, prefer accessibility IDs, wait for stable UI after each navigation, then observe again.
- Save raw full-quality screenshots before composition.

MobAI CLI route:
- Keep component versions separate. The 2026-07-13 verified snapshot is desktop `2.5.1`, MCP `2.5.0`, and npm CLI `2.1.1`; the desktop release body has no detailed notes, while MCP commit `414f858` is the public source for 2.5-era loop and host-scripting behavior.
- Check the current CLI first: `npm view @mobai-app/cli dist-tags.latest`, then prefer `npx @mobai-app/cli@latest` or a verified global install.
- Use `mobai version`; `mobai --version` is not valid on the verified CLI contract.
- `mobai devices list`
- set `MOBAI_DEVICE` for the target device
- `mobai observe --include ui_tree`
- navigate with stable selectors or accessibility IDs
- `mobai wait --stable --timeout-ms 3000`
- `mobai screenshot --full --path ./screenshots/raw --name <platform-device-slot>`
- use `mobai record` for screen recordings when product-demo clips are needed and the current CLI supports it

MobAI MCP 2.5-era DSL route:
- Read `mobai://reference/device-automation` and `mobai://reference/testing` from the active server before using new actions.
- `repeat` takes exactly one of `times`, `while`, `until`, or `condition`; set an explicit `max_iterations` for predicate/condition loops and validate counted-loop parameters because `times` has no engine safety cap.
- `run_script`/`eval_script` run host-side JavaScript, not device web JavaScript. The restricted VM has `vars`/`output`, synchronous HTTP, captured console output, selected built-ins, and no filesystem, `require`/`import`, or device access.
- Never embed secrets or credential headers in `.mob`/JavaScript: referenced script files are embedded in compiled DSL. Seed authenticated fixtures through a separate approved Doppler-wrapped setup step and pass MobAI only non-secret IDs unless a current secret-safe action is explicitly reviewed.
- Limit host HTTP to allowlisted test/staging endpoints, validate responses as untrusted data, and record fixture cleanup plus backend proof separately from UI success.

Recorder-skill route:
- For iOS or Android app demos, use `https://github.com/MobAI-App/mobile-recorder-skill` after refreshing current `README.md`, `install.md`, and `skills/mobile-recorder/SKILL.md`.
- For macOS or web demos, use `https://github.com/MobAI-App/desktop-recorder-skill` after refreshing current `README.md`, `install.md`, and `skills/desktop-recorder/SKILL.md`.
- Mobile recorder produces a reproducible `.mob` choreography, native device recording, tap ripples, finger overlay, phone bezel/background, zoom, variable speed, captions, final mp4, and upload copy.
- Desktop recorder produces a reproducible `screenplay.json`, native recording, click ripples, cursor sprite, captions, zoom, variable speed, final mp4, and upload copy.
- Follow the upstream golden rule: explore -> script/screenplay -> dry-run -> record -> edit/export. Never improvise during the final recording.
- Create `DEMO_VIDEO.md` for launch demo videos and link `.mob` or `screenplay.json`, raw captures, final exports, captions, and upload copy.

Confirmed free fallback:
- MobAI is freemium: use its free tier without a spend gate when one device/current quotas fit, but ask before Plus/Pro spend. If MobAI is unavailable and the lane is iOS-only, the in-app iOS Simulator (rung 0) is the first fallback — free, zero-setup, no spend gate — and only the lost Android/suite/CI/physical-device coverage needs recording per `paid-tool-routing.md`. Escalate to XcodeBuildMCP when the lane needs scripted builds, CI, or physical hardware, and record the Apple-only limitation either way.
- After confirmation, load `xcodebuildmcp-testing.md` for iOS/iPadOS/macOS/tvOS/watchOS/visionOS build, run, UI automation, screenshot, video, and log workflows.
- Refresh official XcodeBuildMCP docs and local `xcodebuildmcp --help`/`xcodebuildmcp tools` output before setup commands, CLI syntax, MCP tool names, screenshot captures, or readiness proof.
- Use XcodeBuildMCP for Apple simulator/device captures and record the missing MobAI coverage. Use Android emulator/ADB or mark Android proof blocked for Android-only flows.

In-app native iOS route (rung 0, both runtimes):
- In Claude Code Desktop on a Mac (local sessions only — never cloud or SSH), state the goal plainly ("run the app in the iOS Simulator and tap through the signup flow"); the simulator pane opens itself when the app runs. Consent is per device, and screenshots of the device leave the machine — use fixture/sandbox accounts only, never a real account.
- In Codex with the `build-ios-apps` plugin, call `session_show_defaults` before the first build/run/test, use `build_run_sim` when defaults are set, read the accessibility hierarchy before interacting, and prefer stable labels over raw coordinates.
- Record the runtime and app version, the plan/policy gate cleared, that the session was local, the simulated device and OS, the fixture account, output paths, and the simulator-only/no-Android/no-distribution limitation in `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`.

CLI proof tools:
- SnapshotPreviews (`https://github.com/getsentry/SnapshotPreviews`) exports preview PNG/JSON proof from XCTest. Link `SnapshottingTests`, use `SnapshotTest` or `PreviewLayoutTest`, set `TEST_RUNNER_SNAPSHOTS_EXPORT_DIR`, and record that this is preview-only coverage.
- serve-sim (`https://github.com/EvanBacon/serve-sim`) streams and controls a booted iOS Simulator in a browser. Run `npx serve-sim` for the default `http://localhost:3200` preview, record the booted simulator/device, URL/port, actions, logs, and the limitation that simulator streaming does not replace provider proof or App Store signing readiness.

Record in `SCREENSHOTS.md`:
- platform, device model/class, OS, app build, locale, theme, account fixture, and data fixture
- screen path and selector path used to reach it
- raw capture path
- demo choreography path: `.mob` or `screenplay.json` when recording video
- design-system frame/composition path
- final upload path and dimensions
- Apple display well or Google device class satisfied
- visual QA notes and upload status

Rules:
- Do not use generated art as a replacement for real app UI.
- Use Higgsfield for supporting backgrounds, mascots, icons, motion, or frame art only after the app screen is truthful.
- Keep raw captures separate from final upload assets.
- If capture is blocked by missing device/app access, leave the exact blocker. Continue with a clearly labeled design-system mock only after the founder approves the fallback.
