## Doppler And Secret Routing

Load `secrets-management.md` before adding or using secrets. Default to Doppler unless the founder selected another provider.

Refresh current Doppler official docs and `https://docs.doppler.com/llms.txt` before installation, setup, service-token, or CI/live-environment instructions. Record docs checked date, docs URLs, observed CLI version/install route, and any docs-vs-local mismatch in `SECRETS.md`.

Local check:
```bash
doppler --version
doppler setup
doppler run -- npm test
```

Rules:
- `doppler login` and account/project access are founder/operator actions when authentication is required.
- Run `doppler me` before secrets work to confirm the active account.
- **Config name preflight:** Before any `doppler run --project X --config Y` command, read the config name from `SECRETS.md` or run `doppler configs --project X`. Never guess from memory (e.g. "prod" vs "prd" differ by project and both are valid naming conventions).
- Use `doppler run -- <command>` for local commands that need secrets.
- Use Doppler service tokens, provider integrations, OIDC, or platform-native secrets for CI/live environments.
- Do not print `doppler secrets get --plain` output.
- **Env file extraction:** Never `source` a `.env`, `.p8`, or credential file. Use `awk -F= '/^KEY=/{print $2}' file` for single values. Do not commit awk/shell extraction snippets that print raw credential values to committed docs.
- **JS inside doppler run:** When the command contains JavaScript template literals (`${...}`), pass the script via a single-quoted heredoc (`doppler run -- node --input-type=module <<'NODE' ... NODE`) so bash does not expand template syntax before Doppler injects secrets.
- Update `SECRETS.md` whenever a new secret, `process.env`, webhook signing secret, provider key, service-account file, app-store credential, mobile build setting, or CI/deploy secret appears.
- Commit `.env.example` names only; never commit `.env`, private keys, service-account JSON, signing files, OAuth refresh tokens, or raw provider keys.
