/**
 * Deterministic gate for a single ONB-03..ONB-08 evidence-research node's own output packet.
 *
 * These nodes are domain.experience with no fresh-context judgment path wired into the
 * production runner (core/session/run.ts's acceptVerification() is only ever called from the
 * deterministic-gate branch; fresh_context acceptance exists only in test fixtures) — so a
 * deterministic gate is the only verification path that actually promotes the node to succeeded
 * in a real durable run. This gate cannot judge whether the research is TRUE (that needs a real
 * reviewer, which does not exist yet); it only rejects the mechanical shape of an empty,
 * stub-length, or still-templated packet, closing the "any returned artifact ID is accepted"
 * gap enough to stop a trivially empty or placeholder packet from unlocking ONB-09.
