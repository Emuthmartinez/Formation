/**
 * check-generated-pages.ts — no page in business/ is hand-authored, and none is
 * left undeclared.
 *
 * The four pages this gate was written for had all drifted from their Markdown
 * sources while the audit stayed green: trust/security-review.html was missing about ten
 * of the fifteen sections its own opening line claimed to cover, store/store-console.html
 * had lost the entire App Review checklist that prevents a Guideline 2.1 rejection,
 * product/onboarding.html carried one screen's content under another screen's heading, and
 * operations/orchestration.html contained a table row that had never been real. Nothing could
 * catch any of it, because nothing knew the pages had sources.
 *
 * Three assertions, and all three are needed. Any one alone passes vacuously:
 *
 *   1. Every root-level business/*.html appears in the manifest. Without this a
 *      new hand-authored page is simply invisible.
 *   2. Every manifest entry's file exists. Without this a deleted page reads as
 *      "nothing to check".
 *   3. Every `authored-from` page byte-matches a fresh render. Without this the
 *      first two only prove that a file exists under a name.
 *
 * This grades a launch's founder-facing documents rather than the skill's own
 * upkeep, so it is a gate; it spans store, trust, experience and process subjects
 * at once, so it is filed under the cross-cutting process domain.
 *
 * npm script: check:generated-pages
 * Usage: tsx validation/business/process/check-generated-pages.ts [--root /path/to/business] [--page <html-path>]
 *
 * --page scopes assertions 2 and 3 to one declared page (used by a node-specific gate, such as
 * ONB-22's own acceptance check, that must not fail because an unrelated page elsewhere in the
 * manifest is stale). Assertion 1 (every page on disk is declared) is inherently repo-wide and is
 * skipped in this mode -- an undeclared sibling page is not this node's problem to catch.
