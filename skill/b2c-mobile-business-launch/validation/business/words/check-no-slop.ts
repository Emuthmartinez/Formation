/**
 * check-no-slop.ts — the repo's own front door follows the writing standard it ships.
 *
 * knowledge/words/no-slop-writing.md §2 names a "third surface" this file's rules cover
 * beyond founder-facing and generated marketing copy: the repo's own public docs. The
 * enforcement primitives (banned words, mechanical slop patterns, the em-dash budget) have
 * lived in tooling/lib/no-slop-rules.ts since they were built for check:app-copy, but
 * nothing ever pointed them at this third surface — a skill that ships a writing standard
 * and exempts its own front door from it is enforcing words rather than work.
 *
 * Two severity tiers, both from the reference's own text: README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md,
 * SECURITY.md, and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md are the repo's public face and fail the gate.
 * AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md are maintainer-only guidance — a slip there gets a warning, not
 * a blocked merge. Empty adverbs and empty phrases stay warnings on every file regardless
 * of tier, matching their documented advisory nature in no-slop-rules.ts: they are cut when
 * they add nothing and kept when they carry real emphasis, which is a judgment call this
 * gate cannot make, only flag.
 *
 * npm script: check:no-slop
 * Usage: tsx validation/business/words/check-no-slop.ts [--repo-root /path] [--skill-root /path]
