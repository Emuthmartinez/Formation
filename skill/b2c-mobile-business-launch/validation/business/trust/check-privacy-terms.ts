/**
 * check-privacy-terms.ts — the mechanically checkable subset of the legal/privacy risk
 * checklist in knowledge/trust/privacy-terms.md §7.
 *
 * That checklist names ten concrete rejection and legal-exposure risks reviewers, app-store
 * review, and regulators actually flag against consumer apps. Two of the ten already have an
 * owning gate (fake testimonials: check:emotional-design / check:vibecoded-tells Tier 1) and
 * are deliberately not re-checked here. This validator covers the rest: privacy/terms
 * existence, the required disclosure sections in trust/PRIVACY.md, cancellation and
 * auto-renewal fairness in trust/TERMS.md, a public-storage-bucket smell in
 * engineering/TECH_SPEC.md and trust/SECURITY.md, and — when trust/AI_SAFETY.md exists — an
 * AI-processing mention in the privacy policy and a named self-harm/crisis response.
 *
 * Mirrors check-security-release.ts: phrase presence, not legal correctness. A green run is
 * not legal sign-off — pair it with the founder/counsel review in LEGAL_REVIEW.md §6.
 *
 * npm script: check:privacy
 * Usage: tsx validation/business/trust/check-privacy-terms.ts --root /path/to/app
