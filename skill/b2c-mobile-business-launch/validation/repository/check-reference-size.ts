/**
 * check-reference-size.ts — per-file context budget for knowledge/ and validation/repository/.
 *
 * Knowledge files load into agent context on demand; a single oversized file
 * silently taxes every launch session that routes through it (the
 * experience-cards.md deck reached ~200KB before it was split into an index
 * plus per-card files). This gate keeps each reference under a generous
 * per-file byte budget so growth becomes a deliberate split/index decision
 * instead of accretion.
 *
 * Exclusions are explicit and carry a reason, in keeping with house culture;
 * an excluded file that drops back under budget warns so the exclusion gets
 * removed.
 *
 * It also enforces the split it recommends: every directory holding knowledge
 * files needs an index linking each child — `<dir>/README.md` for a domain
 * folder, a sibling `<name>.md` for a sub-split — and every link must resolve. Without this, a split
 * rots silently — an unlinked topic file is unreachable and a dangling row
 * sends agents nowhere.
 *
 * npm script: check:reference-size
 * Usage: tsx validation/repository/check-reference-size.ts --skill-root /path/to/skill [--budget-bytes N]

 * Index completeness.

 * Progressive disclosure only works if every file is reachable from an index:
 * a topic file nothing links to cannot be loaded on demand, and a routing row
 * pointing at a deleted file sends agents to a 404. So every directory holding
 * knowledge files needs an index that links each of its immediate children.
 *
 * Two index mechanisms are accepted, because both are load-bearing:
 *   - `knowledge/`             — indexed centrally by the GENERATED
 *                                catalog/generated/routing.md's Reference Index section
 *                                (rendered by catalog/render-routing.ts from
 *                                knowledge manifests' authored `loadWhen` data; a
 *                                catalog reference entry is what makes a knowledge file
 *                                reachable, R20 — the per-directory README/sibling-file
 *                                indexes this used to require were dropped at cutover,
 *                                U11, per the port ledger).
 *   - everything else (today: `validation/repository/`) — the original per-directory
 *                                `<dir>/README.md` or sibling `<parent>/<name>.md` index.
 *
 * Reachability means a real markdown link, not a mention. A filename that only
 * appears in prose or backticks reads as routed to a human skimming the index
 * but is not something an agent can follow, so both directions below are
 * checked against parsed link targets rather than raw text.
