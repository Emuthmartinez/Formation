# The Skill's Own Upkeep

What a maintainer touches to keep this skill green. Nothing here is about running a business, and an agent mid-launch has no reason to load it.

The line matters: a file about *how a launch is run* is method and lives under `../knowledge/` (see [`catalog/generated/routing.md`](../../catalog/generated/routing.md) for the per-domain index), not here. Mixing the two is what made "the skill talking about itself" measure at 22% of the repo when much of that was really the method the skill exists to carry.

The same line decides where a validator lives. **`validation/business/` grades a business launch; `validation/repository/` grades the skill itself** — judged by the subject of the assertion, not by whether the validator takes `--skill-root`. Seven validators sit here for that reason:

| Validator | Grades |
| --- | --- |
| `check-package-parity.ts` | the two package manifests and lockfiles agree with `skill-version.json` |
| `check-skill-version.ts` | the installed runtime is not behind source |
| `check-version-discipline.ts` | a pending change carries a matching version bump and release notes |
| `check-source-freshness.ts` | every tracked external source in `source-registry.yaml` is current |
| `check-reference-size.ts` | no knowledge file blows the per-file context budget, and every folder indexes its children |
| `check-autopilot-contract.ts` | `SKILL.md`'s frontmatter still triggers, against the triggering eval |
| `check-catalog.ts` | stable catalog identities, edges, workflow contracts, and generated-projection drift (`catalog/validate.ts` + `catalog/render-routing.ts --check`) |

Everything else that grades a launch lives in [`../validation/business/`](../business), mirroring the playbook domains. Nothing may hardcode either directory: `../tooling/lib/script-paths.ts` resolves a script by basename and throws on an unknown or ambiguous name.

| Load when | Reference | Produces / gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Writing or auditing a LaunchBench scenario, adding a failure mode to the regression suite, or deciding whether a miss deserves a new gate | [`launchbench-evals.md`](./launchbench-evals.md) | `npm run launchbench` lints scenario definitions and runs the deterministic validator fixtures; `npm run evals:behavioral` is a different gate against a live agent — never claim one as the other |
| Checking whether the installed runtime is behind source, syncing runtime copies, or cutting a version | [`skill-versioning.md`](./skill-versioning.md) | `check:skill-version`, `check:version-discipline` |
| Adding an external link, refreshing an upstream pack, reviewing the weekly source diff, or changing fast-moving setup commands | [`source-freshness-maintenance.md`](./source-freshness-maintenance.md) | `check:source-registry` |
| Registering a new external source the skill depends on | [`source-registry.yaml`](./source-registry.yaml) | machine-read by `check-source-freshness` and the weekly refresh workflow — one row per tracked source, not prose |
| Changing domains, workflows, phases, lanes, operators, providers, context packs, knowledge, or generated routing | [`../../catalog/`](../../catalog) (start at `domains.ts`, `workflows/`, `knowledge/`) | `knowledge:check`, `catalog:render-routing`, `check:catalog` |
