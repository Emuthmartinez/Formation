/**
 * founder-copy.ts — the only sanctioned path from machine state to founder-visible text.
 *
 * Every founder-facing renderer and every founder-facing template goes through this
 * module. Internal state keeps its machine shape (lane ids, status enums, phase codes,
 * route enums) because ~55 validators, the JSON schema, and the shipped business repos
 * depend on those exact values. What a human reads is a translation of them, produced
 * here.
 *
 * Why this file exists: before it, scripts/render-launch-cockpit.ts printed raw
 * PROJECT_STATE.yaml keys straight into HTML, so a founder read rows like
 * "paid_tool_routing | not_started" on their own business dashboard. There was no
 * presentation boundary at all.
 *
 * Rules for editing this file:
 * - Adding a lane, status, phase, autonomy mode, or tool route means adding its label
 *   here in the same commit. check-founder-copy.ts fails when a value in
 *   lib/launch-state.ts has no label here, so the two cannot drift.
 * - Labels are sentence case, plain language, and free of internal vocabulary. They are
 *   read by a founder who may know nothing about stores, providers, or launch sequencing.
 * - Never put an identifier, enum value, phase code, or tool name in a label.
 * - Keep labels short enough for a table cell. Put the explanation in the blurb.
