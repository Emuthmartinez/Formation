/**
 * script-paths.ts — one source of truth for where a spawnable script lives.
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE.md splits the skill's executables three ways: `gates/` proves a
 * business launch, `machine/` proves the skill itself, and `scripts/` keeps the
 * renderers, runners, probes, seeds and shared lib. So no caller can spawn a
 * script by concatenating a directory onto a basename any more.
 *
 * Guessing wrong is worse than crashing. A validator fixture that asserts only
 * "exit code 1" PASSES when the path is wrong, because a missing file also
 * exits non-zero — ~700 assertions could go green while testing nothing. That
 * is why resolution is a lookup that THROWS on a miss, never a string
 * concatenation, and why an ambiguous basename is an error rather than a
 * first-match-wins.
 *
 * Paths come back POSIX-style (forward slashes) on every platform. They are
 * spawned as argv, embedded in package.json command strings, and compared
 * against markdown — all of which are forward-slash everywhere. Returning
 * path.join output here would be green on macOS and broken on Windows.
