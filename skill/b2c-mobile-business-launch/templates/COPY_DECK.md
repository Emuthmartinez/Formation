# Copy Deck

Status: template — every copy cell below is example voice from Fernpath, a fictional daily-walks app. Author this product's own words cell by cell, then set the status to `authored` with the date. `check:app-copy` fails a deck that ships example or unfilled cells.

The deck is the single source for every string a user reads in the app. Builders type what a row says; a screen with no row stops the build until the row is authored. Voice comes from `COPY_BRIEF.md` and `BRAND.md`; craft rules and surface formulas live in `references/conversion-copy.md`; which locales ship comes from `LOCALIZATION_MARKET_RESEARCH.md`.

Keys are the app's localization keys — the same name flows from this deck into the string resources unchanged where the format allows dots (String Catalogs, i18next); for ARB + `gen-l10n` and Android `strings.xml`, dots become underscores (the mechanical transform recorded in `TECH_SPEC.md`). Locale tier: `1` ships translated at launch, `2` ships source language, `3` deferred.

Case system (from `COPY_BRIEF.md`): sentence case everywhere except proper nouns.

## Allowed terms

None yet. Add a product-owned word here (with a one-line reason) only when `check:app-copy` would otherwise read it as internal vocabulary.

## Handoff checks

- Every screen the build plan names has its rows here before the build starts.
- Keys ship into the string resources via the mechanism and key transform `TECH_SPEC.md` records (unchanged where dots are allowed; dots→underscores for ARB and `strings.xml`).
- Read each surface aloud once; rewrite anything that sounds like a system explaining itself.
- `npm run check:app-copy -- --root <app> --state PROJECT_STATE.yaml` passes (a relative state path joins the root).
