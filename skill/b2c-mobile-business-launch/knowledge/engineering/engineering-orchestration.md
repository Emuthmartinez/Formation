# Engineering Orchestration And Production Readiness

## Mobile Quality And Software Supply Chain

Keep a third-party SDK inventory. Record the owner, version, purpose, permissions, data use, update route, and removal route. Review privacy manifests and transitive dependencies before release.

Test adaptive layouts, offline behavior, startup time, app size, and battery use on supported devices. Record measured evidence in `engineering/APP_QUALITY.md`. Do not use a simulator-only build as proof for battery or production-vitals claims.

Use this before building the actual app, coordinating frontend/backend work, writing `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`, creating `engineering/TECH_SPEC.md` or `engineering/ENGINEERING_PLAN.md`, dispatching subagents, using Compound Engineering skills, or declaring production readiness.

Load `parallel-agent-orchestration.md` alongside this file before multi-lane work, subagent dispatch, worktree routing, `operations/ORCHESTRATION.md`, or any claim that parallel agents were used safely.

The goal is to turn the launch package into shippable software without losing strategy, design, analytics, entitlement, or testing truth.

## 1. Compound Engineering Routing

Load `compound-engineering-routing.md` first for the enforceable route, state contract, freshness check, and artifact requirements.

Use Compound Engineering skills for non-trivial engineering-heavy work when available:

- `ce-brainstorm`: use after research when product shape, user behavior, scope boundaries, or success criteria are still ambiguous.
- `ce-plan`: use when research/spec/design/analytics docs are ready and the app needs an implementation plan.
- `ce-work`: use to execute a concrete plan or bounded implementation prompt.
- `ce-worktree`: use for isolated parallel feature lanes, PR review, or when the current checkout must stay clean.
- `ce-code-review`: use when implementation should be reviewed against requirements and autofixed when possible.
- `ce-test-browser`: use for web/local browser verification.
- `ce-test-xcode`: use for iOS build/test verification when applicable.
- `ce-proof` or `ce-demo-reel`: use when a visual or behavioral proof artifact helps the founder or reviewer inspect what shipped.

Do not route tiny doc-only edits or one-file copy changes through the full pipeline. Use Compound Engineering where the app build is multi-step, cross-surface, or production-sensitive. For core engineering work, record the route in `state/PROJECT_STATE.yaml` `compound_engineering`, `operations/ORCHESTRATION.md`, `engineering/ENGINEERING_PLAN.md`, and `engineering/PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`.

If Compound Engineering skills are unavailable in the current runtime, do not silently skip them. Record the unavailable route and equivalent fallback in `operations/ORCHESTRATION.md`, `state/PROJECT_STATE.yaml`, and `engineering/ENGINEERING_PLAN.md`, then run the Standalone Engineering Loop below — a fallback reason alone is documentation, not a path. `check:compound-engineering` errors when CE is unavailable and `engineering/ENGINEERING_PLAN.md` does not record the loop.

## 1b. Standalone Engineering Loop (CE Unavailable)

The Standalone Engineering Loop is the in-skill engineering path when `compound_engineering.availability` is `unavailable` or the route is `ce_fallback`. It works in any runtime — clone, CI, cloud session, or a machine without the CE plugin — and holds the same evidence bar as the CE pipeline. Record `Standalone Engineering Loop` in `engineering/ENGINEERING_PLAN.md` together with the `fallback_reason` in `state/PROJECT_STATE.yaml`.

The five stages, each with a CE-equivalent artifact:

1. **Plan** (replaces `ce-plan`): write `engineering/ENGINEERING_PLAN.md` to the full §6 contract — requirements trace, implementation units with repo-relative paths, orchestration strategy, secret/flag/migration impacts, and test scenarios. If product shape is still ambiguous, resolve it with founder questions or an explicit assumptions block (replaces `ce-brainstorm`) before planning.
2. **Bounded slices** (replaces `ce-work`): execute one implementation unit at a time against the plan; never let a slice grow past its named files without updating `operations/ORCHESTRATION.md`. Use worktrees or subagent file-ownership lanes per `parallel-agent-orchestration.md` when isolation helps (replaces `ce-worktree`).
3. **Adversarial review** (replaces `ce-code-review`): review each slice against the plan's requirements with a separate pass — a different agent, subagent, or at minimum a fresh session that reads the diff against `engineering/ENGINEERING_PLAN.md` and `engineering/TECH_SPEC.md` contracts. The producer of a slice is not its only reviewer.
4. **Test** (replaces `ce-test-browser`/`ce-test-xcode`): run the plan's test scenarios — happy path, edge, error, integration — plus the device/simulator routes from §8 when mobile journeys are in scope.
5. **Proof** (replaces `ce-proof`/`ce-demo-reel`): produce inspectable evidence — screenshots, run logs, validator output, backend records — and attach it to `engineering/PRODUCTION_READINESS.md` exactly as the CE route would.

Do not downgrade the bar because CE is missing: the engineering lane stays `partial` until all five stages have evidence, and §7 production-readiness gates apply unchanged.

## 2. Autonomy And Project State

Before implementation starts, create or refresh `state/PROJECT_STATE.yaml` and choose an autonomy mode:

- `scout`: read/research only
- `draft`: local docs and mocks
- `prepare`: setup plans and preflight packets
- `apply`: repo edits and tests
- `mutate`: founder-approved provider/API/CLI mutations
- `ship`: founder-approved release, submission, or public posting

Implementation work normally runs in `apply`. Provider/store/social mutations require `mutate` or `ship` with a named founder approval scope.

The orchestrator owns state updates:
- lane status and blockers
- provider docs checked date, preflight, validation, fallback, and required secret names
- proof commands and evidence paths
- active failure cards
- top-level `orchestration` strategy, candidate units, serialized resources, spawned agents, collision checks, integration proof, and validator runs
- LaunchBench/validator runs

Render `state/launch-cockpit.html` after material changes so the founder can inspect state without reading every doc.

## 3. 11-Star Experience And Product Brainstorm Checkpoint

After research and before engineering specs are actioned, decide whether the product is ready for implementation planning.

Create or update `11_STAR_EXPERIENCE.md` and `11-star-experience.html` before engineering work starts. The engineering plan should inherit the V1 scalable slice, not invent the magical moment from screen sketches.

When a feature's 11-star target is 6-star or higher, also load [`emotional-experience-design.md`](../experience/emotional-experience-design.md): a feature flagged for an Experience Card (Commitment, Variable Reward, Perceived Effort Delay, Intent Mirroring, or one of the eight satellite cards in `experience-cards.md`) needs that card's PostHog events, ethics-guardrail attestation, and motion-contract spring implemented before engineering can call the screen done — this does not surface from naming the mechanic alone (a "streak screen" prompt, not "the Streak/Loss-Aversion card").

Use `ce-brainstorm` when:
- AppKittie/XPOZ/Firecrawl findings reveal competing wedges.
- V1/V2/V3 boundaries are still disputed.
- onboarding, paywall, core loop, or activation can reasonably take multiple product shapes.
- user roles, data ownership, or success criteria are unclear.
- the agent would otherwise invent product behavior inside an engineering plan.

Outputs from the brainstorm should become the product requirements source for `ce-plan`. Preserve product intent, actors, key flows, acceptance examples, scope boundaries, and explicit non-goals.

If the research already makes the product direction obvious, skip the brainstorm and go directly to `ce-plan`.

## 4. Agent Entrypoints

Every real app build or builder handoff should create or update a business-specific `AGENTS.md` from `business/engineering/repo-agent-entrypoints/AGENTS.md`. Do not copy the skill repo's maintainer `AGENTS.md`. Keep `AGENTS.md` as a map to source docs, active plans, validation commands, and failure cards instead of a duplicate manual.

`AGENTS.md` must include:
- 60-second product brief
- explicit instruction to keep using `b2c-mobile-business-launch` for broad launch/business work without requiring another founder prompt
- repo map and first files to read
- source-of-truth docs: `product/SPEC.md`, `strategy/RESEARCH.md`, `state/LAUNCH_TRACE.md`, `11_STAR_EXPERIENCE.md`, `engineering/TECH_SPEC.md`, `design/design.md`, `product/copy/COPY_DECK.md` (every user-facing string; builders type deck rows, never spec vocabulary — `conversion-copy.md`), `analytics/ANALYTICS.md`, `product/ONBOARDING.md`, `revenue/REVENUE_OPS.md`, `trust/PRIVACY.md`, `store/APPLE_SIGNING.md`, `store/STORE_CONSOLE.md`
- `state/PROJECT_STATE.yaml`, `state/launch-cockpit.html`, active failure cards, and autonomy mode
- V1 scope, V2/V3 scope, and banned scope
- design-system and HTML proof rules
- analytics and attribution rules
- RevenueCat/Stripe entitlement rules when monetized
- secret-management rules: `SECRETS.md`, Doppler or approved provider, `doppler run --` wrappers, service token/provider-integration plan, CI/deploy injection, and no raw secrets in docs/logs/proofs
- privacy/legal/store disclosure constraints
- Compound Engineering routing: when to use `ce-brainstorm`, `ce-plan`, `ce-work`, worktrees, subagents, and review
- MobAI/native iOS/device-testing rules and serialized device ownership
- paid-tool routing and confirmed MobAI/XcodeBuildMCP fallback rules plus SnapshotPreviews/serve-sim limits
- backend/frontend E2E proof requirements
- common mistakes and launch blockers
- exact verification commands or scripts when known
- bundled validator/LaunchBench commands when copied into or callable from the repo

`CLAUDE.md` should exist when Claude Code or a builder expects it. Start from `business/engineering/repo-agent-entrypoints/CLAUDE.md` and keep it short:
- point to `AGENTS.md` as canonical
- remind Claude to keep using `b2c-mobile-business-launch` for launch/business work
- list Claude-specific skills/plugins/tools if useful
- avoid duplicating product truth that will drift

Do not let generated builders rely on a prompt only. Durable repo-local instructions are part of the launch package.

### 4b. App-Local Agent Roster

Every real app build or builder handoff should include `APP_AGENTS.md` and a tiny `agents/` directory so future work can continue without reinventing responsibilities. Use `app-agent-roster.md` as the detailed contract — the seven required roles, their ownership, the subagent audit pattern, and the attribution audit gate are defined there, not restated here.

## 5. Parallel Agent Orchestration

Use `parallel-agent-orchestration.md` as the detailed contract. This section is the engineering-specific summary.

At the start of broad launch or build work, the orchestrator should ask:
- what critical-path work should stay local
- what independent sidecar work can run in parallel
- which specialists can improve consistency or catch launch-grade misses
- which files, providers, devices, accounts, and git actions are shared resources
- whether the current runtime actually allows subagent delegation

For broad multi-lane work, the orchestrator must either dispatch read-only or isolated specialist audits from `APP_AGENTS.md`, or record why subagents are unavailable, unsafe, or not useful in `operations/ORCHESTRATION.md` and `state/PROJECT_STATE.yaml`.

Good parallel lanes:
- AppKittie competitor/review pass, XPOZ social-language pass, Firecrawl web pass
- privacy/data inventory, ASO metadata, analytics catalog, and design audit when files do not overlap
- independent skill-definition audits for attribution, onboarding, analytics, revenue, store, privacy, security, design, and production-readiness coverage
- frontend and backend implementation in separate repos or isolated worktrees
- test-writing or fixture-building units with non-overlapping files
- screenshot planning, store-console copy, and launch calendar drafting

Do not parallelize:
- edits to the same files
- migrations plus backend code that depend on the migration state unless sequenced
- device automation on the same simulator/device
- git staging, commits, merges, or releases
- final production-readiness decision

Parallel safety check:
- Map every candidate unit to create/modify/test files.
- If two units touch the same file, run them serially.
- Record the decision in `operations/ORCHESTRATION.md` and the top-level `state/PROJECT_STATE.yaml` `orchestration` block before dispatch.
- Use specialist subagents to audit against the skill definition before declaring completeness, especially for attribution, monetization, store-console, privacy, email, and E2E readiness.
- Use one orchestrator to reconcile `state/PROJECT_STATE.yaml` and failure cards after parallel work; specialists should not independently mark lanes done.
- For parallel implementation in one repo, the orchestrator owns staging, commits, and full test suites.
- Instruct parallel subagents not to run project-wide suites, stage files, or commit.
- After parallel work returns, compare actual modified files, resolve collisions, run focused tests, then run integration/E2E suites.

Use `ce-worktree` when parallel engineering lanes need isolation. Prefer meaningful branch/worktree names such as `feat/onboarding-analytics` or `fix/revenuecat-entitlement-sync`.

MobAI is serialized: one orchestrator owns the device flow, while other agents may inspect code, prepare fixtures, or analyze logs in parallel. Its free tier needs no spend approval; Plus/Pro-only capabilities do. If MobAI is unavailable, use [`paid-tool-routing.md`](../operations/paid-tool-routing.md) before substituting XcodeBuildMCP or another device/simulator route because the replacement changes platform coverage and proof quality.

## 6. `engineering/ENGINEERING_PLAN.md` Requirements

Before `ce-work` or a generated builder starts, produce `engineering/ENGINEERING_PLAN.md` through `ce-plan` or an equivalent implementation-plan doc.

The plan must include:
- requirements trace to launch docs and `state/LAUNCH_TRACE.md` IDs
- 11-star V1 scalable slice, line of feasibility, and magical-moment proof requirements
- `state/PROJECT_STATE.yaml` phase, autonomy mode, active blockers, and failure cards that constrain implementation
- `engineering/TECH_SPEC.md` pointer or inline technical contracts when data/API/state/integration behavior is in scope
- `product/copy/COPY_DECK.md` coverage for every screen the units build, and the string-externalization mechanism from `engineering/TECH_SPEC.md` §Strings And Localization Readiness
- [`premium-mobile-craft.md`](../design/premium-mobile-craft.md) acceptance-criteria coverage for every screen the units build — press states, motion, haptics, loading/empty states — the same per-screen bar the COPY_DECK.md line above already sets for copy
- implementation units with repo-relative file paths
- orchestration strategy, candidate units, safe parallel lanes, serialized lanes, worktree needs, shared resources, and subagent forbidden actions from `operations/ORCHESTRATION.md`
- frontend, backend, database, analytics, revenue, email, and store-console impacts
- secret impacts: new secret or env var, secret class, Doppler/provider routing, service token/provider-integration plan, CI/deploy injection, `.env.example` names-only updates, and bundle-safety checks
- feature flags or rollout controls
- migration and data-backfill plan when needed
- auth/session, permission, app integrity, API/RPC/webhook, and state-machine impacts when relevant
- test scenarios for happy path, edge cases, error paths, and integration paths
- MobAI/native iOS/device-test scenarios for mobile user journeys, plus XcodeBuildMCP/SnapshotPreviews/serve-sim scenarios when they are the Apple-platform proof route
- backend verification scenarios showing real test data persisted or projected correctly
- production-readiness gates and known blockers
- validator and LaunchBench checks that must pass before done

Do not put unsupported product behavior into `engineering/ENGINEERING_PLAN.md`. Send unresolved product questions back to `ce-brainstorm` or make explicit assumptions.

## 7. End-To-End Production Readiness

Do not mark an app build production-ready from unit tests alone.

Required proof, adjusted to the product:
- build/typecheck/lint pass for every touched repo
- unit tests for pure logic and edge cases
- integration tests for app-to-backend, provider callbacks, database writes, entitlement projection, email sends, and analytics wrappers
- browser E2E for web funnels, checkout, privacy/terms pages, support flows, and dashboards where applicable
- mobile E2E for onboarding, attribution, paywall, restore, activation, settings, account deletion, and screenshot-critical flows: in-app iOS Simulator (rung 0) for iOS-only walkthroughs and repro, MobAI for Android coverage and repeatable suites, XcodeBuildMCP when the lane needs scripted/CI builds or physical hardware — record the rung used and the coverage it does not provide
- on-device taste pass for every built screen against `premium-mobile-craft.md`/`quality-lens.md` (see §8 Device Loop's closing step) — functional E2E proof that a screen runs and can be captured is not proof it looks premium, on-brand, or non-generic
- backend proof that frontend actions create the expected records/events in the real test backend, database, Firestore/Supabase/Postgres, RevenueCat, Stripe, Resend, or PostHog target
- app integrity, rate-limit, idempotency, and abuse-path proof when paid access, user accounts, sensitive data, or backend mutation are in scope
- release-build or staging-build verification that mocks are disabled, production flags are sane, and secrets are not bundled
- secret-management verification: `SECRETS.md` covers all secret-bearing services, commands use `doppler run --` or the approved provider wrapper, CI/deploy injects secrets from the selected provider, and public bundles contain no server secrets
- rollback or kill-switch plan for risky features
- `state/PROJECT_STATE.yaml` updated with final lane statuses, proof, and unresolved founder-only gates
- `state/launch-cockpit.html` rendered from current state

Record proof in `engineering/PRODUCTION_READINESS.md` or the repo's existing release/readiness artifact:
- command run
- environment
- account/fixture used
- evidence path or dashboard link
- expected result
- actual result
- blocker or follow-up

Attribution-specific production-readiness proof is mandatory when onboarding, signup, or waitlist exists:
- the user sees the attribution screen early in the flow
- the stored source is a stable stored key, not display copy
- `other` captures sanitized free text or a documented follow-up value
- PostHog receives `attribution_source_selected`
- PostHog person properties include `self_reported_source`
- backend/profile storage contains the source once identity exists
- anonymous attribution is stitched to the identified user after signup/login

## 8. In-App Simulator, MobAI, Native iOS Proof, And Device Testing

Start at rung 0. On a local Mac with Xcode, the in-app iOS Simulator (Claude Code Desktop's simulator pane, or Codex with the `build-ios-apps` plugin) builds, installs, launches, taps, reads the screen, screenshots, records, and streams logs with no install and no account — use it for "run the app", "check this screen", "walk this flow", and "reproduce this bug". Escalate per the Route Ladder in `xcodebuildmcp-testing.md`. Use MobAI MCP for Android, repeatable `.mob` suites, multi-device runs, performance gates, and polished demo recording. Use the local `using-mobai-cli` skill when only CLI access is available or the environment is unfamiliar.

MobAI is a freemium third-party tool. Use its free tier without a spend gate when one device and the current quota satisfy the lane. Ask before any Plus/Pro upgrade or before replacing the intended cross-platform route; continue after the founder confirms paid capability, provides exports/screenshots, or approves a fallback with recorded platform limits.

Load `xcodebuildmcp-testing.md` before any Apple simulator/device proof, in either runtime. In Claude Code Desktop the simulator pane opens automatically when the agent runs the app in a simulator — local sessions only, per-device consent, fixture accounts only because device screenshots leave the machine. In Codex, call `session_show_defaults` before the first build/run/test and use exposed MCP tools such as `build_run_sim` when defaults are set. Either way record runtime and version, project/workspace, scheme, simulated device and OS, tool names, screenshot/log paths, and the simulator-only limitation in `engineering/PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`.

Use XcodeBuildMCP after confirmation for Apple-platform build/run/test/UI automation/screenshots/logs/video:
- load `xcodebuildmcp-testing.md`
- refresh official XcodeBuildMCP docs and local CLI/tool help before install/setup/commands/proof
- use MCP tools when exposed, otherwise the `xcodebuildmcp-cli` skill and CLI
- run `session_show_defaults` before first MCP build/run/test in a session
- use one-shot build/run tools when defaults are configured
- record Apple-only scope and any missing Android/MobAI coverage
- record docs checked date, docs URLs, CLI/tool snapshot, install route/version, and any docs-vs-skill mismatch in `engineering/PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`

For CLI users, use the same reference before SnapshotPreviews or serve-sim:
- SnapshotPreviews exports SwiftUI/UIKit/AppKit preview PNG/JSON proof through XCTest using `TEST_RUNNER_SNAPSHOTS_EXPORT_DIR`; record it as preview-only coverage, not runtime E2E proof.
- serve-sim exposes a booted iOS Simulator at a browser URL such as `http://localhost:3200`; record simulator/device, URL/port, actions, logs, and the fact that it does not replace provider proof or App Store signing readiness.

Device loop:
- observe UI tree before acting
- prefer accessibility IDs
- act
- wait for stable UI
- observe again
- capture screenshots only after the state is verified
- before recording the screen as production-ready, run the captured screenshot through [`quality-lens.md`](../design/quality-lens.md)'s Anti-Generic Checks and, for surfaces `premium-mobile-craft.md`/`motion-craft-benchmarks.md` govern, confirm the spring/haptics/press-state recipe actually shipped — this loop proves the screen runs, not that it looks premium or on-brand

For store screenshots, keep raw captures separate from composed assets. For E2E readiness, pair each MobAI action sequence with backend/provider verification:
- onboarding answer appears in profile/backend state
- attribution answer appears in analytics/person properties
- purchase or restore activates entitlement in app and RevenueCat/backend
- support/privacy/delete action reaches the intended backend/email route
- lifecycle email/webhook appears in provider logs when expected

If device access is blocked, mark production readiness as blocked for that flow. A cloud, SSH, or container session cannot reach a local Mac's simulators at all, so rung 0 is simply unavailable there: record that as the blocker and route the proof to a machine that can, rather than narrating a simulator run that did not happen. Do not replace live-device proof with screenshots, preview snapshots, or unit tests. If XcodeBuildMCP, SnapshotPreviews, or serve-sim is used, write the exact simulator/device, OS, workflow, output paths, and limitation into `engineering/PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`.

## 9. LaunchBench And Failure Cards

Run deterministic validators where the app repo has the required artifacts or code paths:

```bash
npm run validate:launch-state -- --root .
npm run check:orchestration -- --root .
npm run check:attribution -- --root .
npm run check:secrets -- --root .
npm run check:store-console -- --root .
npm run render:launch-cockpit -- --root .
```

If the scripts are available only from the installed skill, call them with `tsx` and pass the app repo as `--root`.

`npm run launchbench` and `npm run evals:behavioral` are skill-maintainer commands (see `validation/repository/README.md`) — they lint this skill's own LaunchBench scenario definitions and judge whether a fresh agent applies the skill's instructions correctly. Neither one inspects a shipped app's UI code, so do not run either against the app repo above or cite them as production-readiness proof. The `motion-craft-prose-never-applied` LaunchBench scenario exists precisely because motion craft has no deterministic app-side check today: verify it here through the on-device taste pass in §7/§8's Device Loop, or a specialist design-guru review against `premium-mobile-craft.md`/`quality-lens.md`, and record that evidence in `engineering/PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`.

Use failure cards when a validator fails, a subagent finds a launch-grade gap, a provider mutation is blocked, or a known miss reappears. Cards should include severity, owner, evidence, impact, next action, validator, and closure proof. Keep active cards in `state/PROJECT_STATE.yaml`; use `operations/FAILURE_CARDS.md` only when more detail is useful.

## 10. Done Rules

Engineering-heavy work is done only when:
- `AGENTS.md` exists and points to canonical docs.
- `state/PROJECT_STATE.yaml` exists, is current, and `state/launch-cockpit.html` has been rendered when the launch has multiple lanes.
- `CLAUDE.md` exists when Claude/builders need compatibility guidance.
- `APP_AGENTS.md` and its predetermined specialist prompt pack exist for real app builds or handoffs. The pack includes research, product and UX, visual design, copy, marketing and growth, mobile engineering, backend and infrastructure, accessibility and device QA, and security and release review.
- `state/LAUNCH_TRACE.md` exists or equivalent trace rows are embedded in `strategy/RESEARCH.md`.
- `engineering/TECH_SPEC.md` exists when data/API/state/platform contracts are non-trivial.
- `engineering/ENGINEERING_PLAN.md` exists when actual implementation is in scope.
- `operations/ORCHESTRATION.md` exists for multi-lane or subagent-assisted work, and `state/PROJECT_STATE.yaml` records strategy, candidate units, serialized resources, spawned agents, collision checks, integration proof, and validator runs.
- `SECRETS.md` exists when any API key, token, webhook secret, service-account file, CI/deploy secret, store credential, or local env file is in scope.
- Compound Engineering or equivalent workflow produced product requirements, implementation plan, execution, review, and proof for non-trivial app work.
- Parallel agents were considered by default, used where safe, and serialized where required.
- Specialist audit agents or equivalent independent review checked the build against attribution, onboarding, analytics, revenue, store, privacy, design, and production-readiness requirements where in scope.
- frontend, backend, analytics, revenue, email, and mobile-device paths were tested end to end where in scope.
- In-app simulator proof (rung 0), MobAI proof, XcodeBuildMCP proof, serve-sim simulator proof, or SnapshotPreviews preview proof is paired with backend/provider verification where app flows mutate state, and the simulator-only/preview-only/no-Android/no-distribution limits are explicit.
- production-readiness evidence is written down.
- deterministic validators or LaunchBench scenarios were run where applicable, and active failure cards are explicit.
- remaining blockers are explicit founder-only gates, access gaps, platform review waits, or external service issues.
