# Research And Market Intelligence

Use current tools and live data whenever possible. Treat this file as workflow, not fixed facts.

Part of the [Tool Recipes](../tool-recipes.md) index. Before using any paid or account-gated tool named below, honor the **Paid Tool Decision Protocol** and **Founder-Only Gates** in that index.

## AppKittie App-Store Intelligence

Purpose: choose the market/category by revenue and downloads, then position inside or against it. Also use AppKittie to monitor competitors, ads, creators, screenshots, keywords, reviews, and post-launch deltas.

Access:
- AppKittie is a paid/account-gated intelligence path. If unavailable in the runtime, use [`paid-tool-routing.md`](../../operations/paid-tool-routing.md) before substituting public store research.

Run:
- `search_apps` across 3-5 plausible categories or query clusters
- top revenue apps, top download apps, trending apps, and fastest growth apps by downloads/revenue/reviews
- filtered searches for apps with Meta ads, Apple Search Ads, creator partnerships, websites, or contact emails
- `get_app_detail` for the top 5-10 competitors, including screenshots, IAPs, developer/site/socials, historical downloads/revenue/reviews/ratings, ads, and creator partnerships
- `get_app_reviews` for 50-300 recent reviews across the most relevant competitors, depending on credit budget
- `batch_keyword_difficulty` for the candidate name, subtitle, category terms, competitor alternatives, and long-tail pains; use `get_keyword_difficulty` for final deep dives
- `get_supported_countries` before non-US keyword research

Record:
- monthly downloads and revenue estimates
- lifetime downloads/revenue where available
- rating and review count
- update recency
- pricing and trial structure
- in-app purchase tiers
- app age and growth rate
- ad presence and creative pattern
- screenshots and app-store positioning
- user complaints and feature requests
- Meta/ASA ad presence and creative patterns
- creator/influencer partnership signals
- contact emails, websites, and social links for partnership/press/ads research
- keyword popularity, difficulty, traffic, and top-ranking apps by country

Decision rule:
- The storefront category is where users already search and spend.
- The product identity can be a contrarian wedge against that category.
- If a phrase has no search volume, keep it as brand/category creation, not the only acquisition path.
- AppKittie data is directional unless first-party; cite it as estimates and pair it with reviews/social evidence.

## Social-Language Research

Purpose: find the words users already use for the pain.

Sources:
- Reddit subreddits around the job-to-be-done and competitor categories
- TikTok hashtags and creator formats
- X/Twitter keyword clusters
- YouTube/creator comments when the concept is creator-led

Preferred local tool:
- Use XPOZ for Reddit, TikTok, X/Twitter, and Instagram social/market-language research when available.
- Prefer the installed XPOZ MCP/CLI. If only a local CLI exists, resolve its path before use instead of assuming it is on `PATH`.
- Put global flags before the platform: `xpoz-cli --output json tiktok search_posts ...`
- Check auth first: `xpoz-cli --output pretty auth status`
- Useful platforms/methods: `reddit search_posts`, `reddit search_comments`, `reddit get_subreddit_with_posts`, `tiktok search_posts`, `tiktok search_users`, `tiktok get_posts_by_user`, `twitter search_posts`, `twitter count_posts`, `instagram search_posts`, `instagram get_posts_by_user`.

Access:
- XPOZ is a paid/account-gated research path. If auth is missing or the CLI is unavailable, ask before using public search, platform-native browser search, reviews, or founder-provided screenshots as the fallback.

Queries:
- problem phrases from the source spec
- competitor names plus "quit", "alternative", "too much", "expensive", "worth it"
- category verbs, not just nouns
- aspirational phrases and "I wish..." phrases
- trend containers such as "Sunday reset", "weekly review", "AI coach", "habit tracker", adapted to the current product

Record:
- verbatim language
- emotional register
- repeated failure modes
- screenshots/posts worth citing
- social formats that can become ads or organic content

Rules:
- Do not overfit to one viral post.
- Separate broad cultural trend from app-store search behavior.
- Keep sensitive or copyrighted material summarized unless the source allows direct quotation.
- Prefer creator handles, subreddits, compact hashtags, and competitor names over broad generic phrases; broad XPOZ queries are often noisy.
- Record query, platform, date, result URL/post ID/creator handle where possible, and how the evidence changed positioning or copy.

## Firecrawl Web Intelligence

Purpose: inspect public web surfaces that AppKittie and XPOZ do not cover well: competitor landing pages, pricing pages, docs, help centers, policy pages, blog/SEO content, feature pages, and funnel claims.

Use Firecrawl MCP/API when available:
- `firecrawl_search` for broad web discovery with scraped result content
- `firecrawl_map` to discover URLs on a competitor/domain and find pricing, terms, support, blog, FAQ, or docs pages
- `firecrawl_scrape` for a single page when the URL is known
- `firecrawl_crawl` for multi-page competitor/site audits
- `firecrawl_extract` for structured fields such as pricing, plans, claims, CTAs, features, testimonials, integrations, and policy commitments
- batch scrape when comparing several competitors or policy pages

Fallback:
- Firecrawl is a paid/account-gated crawler. If unavailable or blocked, use `paid-tool-routing.md` before switching to ordinary web search, `curl`, browser snapshots, `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`, or manual page notes.

Record:
- source URL, crawl date, page type, extracted facts, claims copied into product/marketing, and claims rejected as unsupported
- competitor pricing and plan names
- funnel steps and CTAs
- support/privacy/contact/deletion pages
- SEO/GEO content patterns: FAQ, schema, blog topics, `llms.txt`, sitemap, and robots behavior

Rules:
- Respect robots, login walls, paywalls, and terms. Do not bypass access controls.
- Use Firecrawl for public web evidence, not for App Store intelligence where AppKittie/ASO tools are stronger.
- Do not rely on Firecrawl metadata extraction alone for schema/security checks; verify important items directly on the live page when launching.

## Refero UX Pattern Research

Purpose: ground web and mobile UX decisions in shipped product screens, styles, and flows before building app screens, onboarding, paywalls, web funnels, settings, support, and legal/account flows.

Current docs basis to refresh at runtime:
- docs index: `https://doc.refero.design/llms.txt`
- MCP server URL: `https://api.refero.design/mcp`
- Getting Started, Tools, Data Model, Examples, and Refero Skill pages

Access:
- Refero is a paid/account-gated design research path. Current docs say Refero Pro is required for MCP use and auth can be OAuth or an Authorization Bearer token.
- If Refero is not available in the runtime, load `paid-tool-routing.md` and ask before using the bundled baseline pattern pack, public inspiration galleries, Page Flows/UI Sources-style public references, app-store screenshots, or founder-provided examples.

Use the current MCP tool names:
- `refero_search_styles` for visual direction, typography, surfaces, spacing, and design-system inspiration.
- `refero_get_style` for full design guidance after choosing style candidates.
- `refero_search_screens` with `platform: "web"` or `platform: "ios"` for concrete UI patterns, components, copy hierarchy, and state handling.
- `refero_get_screen` for detailed screen metadata.
- `refero_get_similar_screens` to expand from one strong reference.
- `refero_get_screen_image` only when metadata is not enough and visual inspection is required.
- `refero_search_flows` with `platform: "web"` or `platform: "ios"` for onboarding, signup, checkout, cancellation, upgrade, account deletion, password reset, permissions, and settings changes.
- `refero_get_flow` for full journey logic, step goals, actions, system responses, and related queries.
- Current Refero docs list `web` and `ios` for screen/flow platform filters. For Android launches, use Refero iOS/mobile findings only as journey evidence, then adapt to Android-native controls, permissions, billing, and device screenshots before marking Android UX ready.

Research packet:
- 3-5 styles for the brand/design direction, with one primary and 1-2 secondary influences.
- 5-10 screens for each critical surface family: onboarding, paywall, pricing, restore, settings/account, support/privacy, empty/error/offline, referral/share, search/filter.
- 2-4 flows for each critical journey: onboarding, purchase/upgrade, cancellation/retention, restore purchases, account deletion, password reset or login recovery, and permission requests when applicable.
- A `UX_PATTERNS.md` source ledger with query, platform, selected records, observed pattern, adopted decision, rejected decisions, and caveats.
- A `ux-patterns.html` or `design/design.html` section rendering pattern inventory, flow maps, state matrix, and bug traps.

Rules:
- Use Refero as research ingredients, not a template library to copy.
- Preserve the onboarding conversion playbook unless the user explicitly approves a named experiment.
- Do not commit paid Refero screenshots unless licensing/permission is clear; summarize metadata and link source records instead.
- Pair Refero findings with product trace rows, analytics events, accessibility checks, and implementation state matrices.
- Record free fallback approval and limitations in `strategy/TOOL_DECISIONS.md` when Refero is unavailable.

## Name And Keyword Collision

Check:
- App Store search and exact title collisions
- high-revenue apps/games using the term
- generic utility apps that own the keyword
- domain availability
- trademark obvious conflicts
- social handle availability when relevant
- pronunciation and "did you do your ___?" usability

Decision rule:
- A beautiful name that is invisible in App Store search can still win if the brand has another acquisition path, but the launch dossier must compensate.
- Do not lock a name until ASO collision and domain options are known.
