# Tool Recipes

Use current tools and live data whenever possible. Treat this file as workflow, not fixed facts.

**This file is the index.** The recipe bodies live in one file per lane under [`tool-recipes/`](./tool-recipes/research-intelligence.md). Load **only the lane in scope** — each lane file is self-contained, and loading all of them for a single DNS change or one ad batch wastes the context the launch work needs.

The two gates below are cross-cutting: they apply to every lane and stay here so they load with the index.

## Recipe Routing

One line per lane: when to load it, and where the bodies live.

| Lane | Load when | Recipes |

## Paid Tool Decision Protocol

Before using a free fallback for any paid or account-gated tool, load `paid-tool-routing.md` and ask the founder to confirm the route. Missing runtime access is not evidence that the founder lacks the paid tool or does not want to use it.

Paid/account-gated lanes in this skill include AppKittie, XPOZ, Firecrawl, Refero, Higgsfield, MobAI Plus/Pro capabilities, Fastlane AI, paid ASO/MMP/ad tools, Sideshift or creator marketplaces, and paid/account features of RevenueCat, Stripe, PostHog, and Resend. MobAI's free tier does not require spend approval; replacing its cross-platform route still requires a recorded coverage decision.

Record the selected route in `strategy/TOOL_DECISIONS.md` or the relevant ops doc:
- paid tool used
- user-provided export used
- free fallback approved
- blocked waiting for access
- deferred with reason

Do not spend tokens on the weaker fallback until the founder confirms.

## Founder-Only Gates

Always ask before:
- switching from an intended paid/account-gated tool to a free fallback
- buying a domain
- changing DNS or MX records that affect receiving mail
- changing billing, subscriptions, pricing, or spend
- using credentials or secrets not already available
- creating paid cloud resources beyond normal free-tier/dev usage
- publishing or materially changing privacy policy, terms, EULA, subscription terms, data deletion commitments, legal, medical, financial, or endorsement claims
- sending partner/creator emails
- sending marketing/broadcast email to real users
- connecting social accounts, changing social profiles, scheduling posts, canceling posts, deleting content, or posting publicly through Fastlane or another social scheduler
- force-pushing, deleting repos, dropping tables, or destructive cleanup
- final App Store submission, launch, merge, or ship/hold calls

Self-resolve:
- category framing when evidence is clear
- brand/design direction within a locked brief
- document organization
- landing stack among low-risk viable options
- sequencing of non-destructive work
