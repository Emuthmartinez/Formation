# Experience Cards

Use this when designing, auditing, or implementing emotionally charged moments in a B2C mobile
app. These cards are the canonical deck for the b2c-mobile-business-launch skill. Each card
names a psychological mechanism, draws a bright/dark line, and gives you a deterministic
checklist for audit and ship.

**This file is the index.** Each file under [`experience-cards/`](./experience-cards/commitment-card.md)
is a compact routing stub — title, one-liner, risk tier, bright/dark lines, and a
served-by-MCP pointer (the three motion-bearing cards also pin their celebrate-family spring
canon for `check:motion-contract`). The full per-card specs (psychology + canonical research,
mechanism steps, real app examples, producer recipe, auditor signals, measurement events,
mobile implementation + reduced-motion, pairings) are served by the Retention Mechanics MCP —
see Live deck access below. Load **only the cards in scope for the current moment**; the
stubs are cheap, and the MCP serves full depth per card so loading the whole deck for a
single paywall pause is never necessary.

**Live deck access (Retention Mechanics MCP).** The deck behind this index is queryable live
when a `retention-mechanics` MCP server is connected (first-party; tools named
`retention_*`; registered as `retention-mechanics-mcp`). When it is connected, prefer it for
card routing and per-card content — it serves the maintained, versioned deck (per-card
`card_version`/`last_reviewed`, canonicalized risk tiers, attestation scaffolds) and exceeds
the bundled twelve in both count and depth: the bundled files route, the MCP serves the full
annotation for every card:

- `retention_search_mechanics` — search the deck by product moment, with funnel-stage and
  ethics-risk-ceiling filters; every result carries the card's do-not-use conditions, so a
  vocabulary match cannot pass as a situation-fit diagnosis.
- `retention_get_mechanic` — one full card, citation confidence passed through verbatim and
  real-app examples marked `illustrative_unverified`.
- `retention_get_ethics_ladder` — the risk tier, bright/dark lines, the attestation fields
  the validator requires at that tier, and a scaffold whose narrative fields are
  intentionally empty (the applying team writes them for its own surface).

The bundled files under `experience-cards/` are the frozen free-layer stubs of the deck's
twelve foundational cards and remain the offline contract at stub depth: every validator and
`npm run audit:ci` run reads the bundled files, never the network, and when the server is not
connected this index and the stubs stay authoritative for routing, risk tiers, the bright/dark
ship-gates, and the pinned motion canon. The full per-card spec is authoritative only through
a live MCP connection — the content boundary between the free layer and the maintained deck
is explicit as of Phase 3 of the deck migration.

**Pre-requisites.** Load these references before applying any card; do not duplicate their
content here:
- `knowledge/experience/eleven-star-experience.md` — star-ladder; every card maps to a level
- `knowledge/design/quality-lens.md` — emotional job, not a generic SaaS wrapper
- `knowledge/experience/onboarding-conversion.md` — paywall timing, App Review popup, consent
- `knowledge/data/analytics-attribution.md` — every emotional moment needs a named PostHog event
- `knowledge/design/design-room.md` / `knowledge/design/design-visual-system.md` — motion tokens and
  reduced-motion rules; every delight animation needs an OS-level fallback
- `knowledge/process/failure-cards.md` — dark-pattern violations become failure cards
- `knowledge/experience/ethics-guardrail.md` — Guardrail Contract, regulatory landscape, risk table

## Card Routing

One line per card: when to load it, and where the full spec lives.

| Card | Load when | Risk | Spec |
|---|---|---|---|
| Commitment | A voluntary user-authored goal can anchor the journey (onboarding goal question, plan setup) | MEDIUM | [`experience-cards/commitment-card.md`](./experience-cards/commitment-card.md) |
| Variable Reward | An outcome genuinely varies and a reveal moment exists (results, generations, daily pulls) | **HIGH** | [`experience-cards/variable-reward-card.md`](./experience-cards/variable-reward-card.md) |
| Perceived Effort Delay | Real computation runs on the user's behalf and can be shown honestly (plan generation, analysis) | MEDIUM | [`experience-cards/perceived-effort-delay-card.md`](./experience-cards/perceived-effort-delay-card.md) |
| Intent Mirroring | A pause can reflect the user's own stated goal back (pre-paywall, return sessions) | MEDIUM | [`experience-cards/intent-mirroring-card.md`](./experience-cards/intent-mirroring-card.md) |
| Endowed Progress | Real prior progress exists to surface before a multi-step task (setup, levels, profiles) | LOW | [`experience-cards/endowed-progress-card.md`](./experience-cards/endowed-progress-card.md) |
| Peak-End | A session has a natural emotional peak and a designable ending (completions, summaries) | MEDIUM | [`experience-cards/peak-end-card.md`](./experience-cards/peak-end-card.md) |
| Streak & Loss Aversion | Continuity itself is the value and a free recovery path will ship (habits, daily practice) | **HIGH** | [`experience-cards/streak-and-loss-aversion-card.md`](./experience-cards/streak-and-loss-aversion-card.md) |
| Reciprocity | An unprompted, real gift can precede any ask (bonus content, surprise upgrades) | MEDIUM | [`experience-cards/reciprocity-card.md`](./experience-cards/reciprocity-card.md) |
| Identity & Self-Expression | Users can shape something that reflects who they are (avatars, spaces, collections) | MEDIUM | [`experience-cards/identity-and-self-expression-card.md`](./experience-cards/identity-and-self-expression-card.md) |
| Fresh Start | A temporal landmark can reopen a lapsed journey without guilt (new week/month, post-milestone) | MEDIUM | [`experience-cards/fresh-start-card.md`](./experience-cards/fresh-start-card.md) |
| Mastery & Status | Skill genuinely grows and earned tiers can be shown truthfully (progressions, badges) | MEDIUM | [`experience-cards/mastery-and-status-card.md`](./experience-cards/mastery-and-status-card.md) |
| Recovery & Trust Repair | A failure state (error, crash, failed payment, lapsed streak) needs to win trust back | MEDIUM | [`experience-cards/recovery-and-trust-repair-card.md`](./experience-cards/recovery-and-trust-repair-card.md) |

## Card Shape

**Bundled stub field set** — what each file under `experience-cards/` carries on disk:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **One-liner** | Single-sentence description of what the card does |
| **Risk tier** | LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH, mirroring this index's routing table and `ethics-guardrail.md` §3 (the canonical pair the parity gate checks) |
| **Bright line / Dark line** | The ethics ship-gate summary; the full guardrail contract is MCP-served and in `ethics-guardrail.md` |
| **Served-by-MCP pointer** | The `retention_get_mechanic` / `retention_get_ethics_ladder` calls that return the full card |
| **Motion binding (canon)** | Motion-bearing cards only: the pinned celebrate-family spring literal `check:motion-contract` keeps undriftable |

**Full deck field set** — served per card by the Retention Mechanics MCP (not shipped in this
repo; the maintained deck is versioned per card):

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Emotional beat** | The precise feeling the card engineers, in the user's voice |
| **Psychology + canonical research** | Mechanism explanation with named sources; `attribution-uncertain` flags where replication is partial |
| **Mechanism steps** | Numbered implementation sequence |
| **Real app examples** | Named apps, named moments, why it works |
| **When to use / When NOT to use** | Trigger conditions and explicit exclusions |
| **Producer recipe** | Step-by-step instructions for applying the card to a feature |
| **Auditor signals — Present / Missing / Misused** | Three-bucket checklist for review |
| **Measurement events** | Named PostHog events, required properties, what each proves |
| **Mobile implementation + reduced-motion** | Platform-specific code notes; OS reduce-motion fallback is mandatory |
| **Bright line / Dark line / Guardrail** | Ethics contract; deterministic ship-gate |
| **Pairs with** | Other cards or references this card composes with |
| **11-star level** | Star-ladder position from `eleven-star-experience.md` |

## Ethics Ladder

**Variable Reward, Streak / Loss Aversion, Scarcity / Urgency, and Social Proof** are
HIGH-risk mechanisms per the risk table in `knowledge/experience/ethics-guardrail.md`. Before any of
these cards ships, the artifact doc (`product/ONBOARDING.md`, `product/SPEC.md`, or `ETHICS.md`) must contain
an experience-card attestation block with all five HIGH-tier fields filled:

```yaml
experience_card:
  id: "<card-slug>"
  mechanism: "<mechanism name>"
  applied_to: "<screen or feature name>"
  star_level: <int>
  posthog_event: "<primary event name>"
  bright_line: "<one sentence>"
  dark_line: "<one sentence>"
  guardrail: "<one sentence>"
  user_control_escape_hatch: "<where the user can disable or opt out>"
  ethics_attestation: "<reviewer name and date>"
```

Run `npm run check:emotional-design -- --root .` before marking any HIGH-risk card
launch-ready. The validator enforces that no required field is empty and that no
`spend_prompt_after_reward` pattern appears in the same screen scope.

All other cards require the four MEDIUM-tier fields: `bright_line`, `dark_line`, `guardrail`,
and (for Perceived Effort Delay) `effort_truthfulness_attestation`.
