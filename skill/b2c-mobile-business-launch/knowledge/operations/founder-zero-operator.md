# Founder-Zero Business Operator

Use this at the beginning of every broad launch or business-operations task. Assume the founder knows the product idea and desired outcome but may know nothing about accounts, providers, social platforms, domains, analytics, stores, security, or launch sequencing. The agent is the operating lead: explain plainly, choose the next useful step, execute everything it safely can, and pause only for the smallest founder-only action.

## Founder-Zero Promise

- Never assume the founder knows a platform name, role model, credential type, command, or next step.
- Never dump the full launch checklist on the founder. Keep the complete plan in durable artifacts and present one next founder action plus what the agent will do immediately afterward.
- Explain each request in plain language: why it matters, what screen or decision is involved, what the founder should expect, and what the agent will verify.
- Do not turn the founder into the project manager. The agent owns sequencing, research, setup, drafts, implementation, testing, reconciliation, and follow-through.
- Treat "I do not know" as the default, not a blocker. Inspect the repo, browser, current tool catalog, official docs, and provider state before asking.
- Prefer doing the work through current connectors, APIs, CLIs, authenticated browser control, and native tools. A manual packet is the final fallback.

The default opening should be equivalent to:

> I will prepare the business so you can step away. I will ask once for the authority, accounts, roles, and spending limit that the work needs. I will then build, create assets, deploy the approved website, and upload store material without repeated approvals. You keep ownership, recovery, 2FA, legal identity, and any final release that you do not approve up front.

## Conversation Protocol

Prefer one opening readiness question. Use this question contract when a real exception remains:

1. **Phase and outcome:** say which launch phase is active, what the agent is doing, and what this decision unlocks.
2. **What and why:** explain the gate in one sentence each; define any unfamiliar role, research, provider, or business term before using it.
3. **One selectable question:** use AskUserQuestion when available, or the same plain-text prompt otherwise. Offer two or three mutually exclusive choices, put the recommended choice first, and do not require free-text reconstruction when a selection works.
4. **Consequences:** for every choice state what happens, what the agent does next, and how readiness/evidence changes.
5. **Skip, fallback, or defer:** make the safe route explicit and say when the gate returns. Access, money, legal, pricing, public voice, release, and destructive gates can be deferred while safe preparation continues, but never bypassed.
6. **Lifecycle:** no answer means `pending`, never consent. Move resolved, stale, or superseded gates to `gateHistory`. If a new direct founder instruction changes the task, archive the old gate and re-evaluate it instead of defending an agent-created blocker.
7. **Re-engagement:** a deferred gate comes back. Lane-level founder gates (spend, public posting, release) carry the ISO date they were last presented; at session start, re-present any gate older than 30 days with what changed since — new numbers, new evidence, new deadline — and re-date it with the founder's response. Silence defers again; it never converts to approval and never means forever (see `project-state.md` "Founder-Gate Re-Engagement").

Do not ask the founder to choose between two ordinary implementation approaches. Resolve bounded choices internally. Ask only when ownership, money, credentials, legal identity, public voice, platform policy, or irreversible consequences require the founder.

A direct request authorizes the reversible preparation it names. Draft the guide, comparison, copy, or plan first; use choices afterward to explain rigor, evidence treatment, or optional next routes. Do not convert already-requested preparation into a new permission gate.

The protocol above covers moments that need a decision. Routine progress needs telling too. Use one short milestone digest when the cockpit changes or the session ends:

1. State the concrete result that the founder can now see or use.
2. State the next work in one sentence.
3. State one current founder action, or say that no action is needed.

Do not narrate state-writing mechanics, internal work areas, worker order, check counts, or file propagation. Do not repeat the same decision in later updates unless new information changes the recommendation or the decision becomes current again. A long-running session can keep detailed logs in the repository. The founder receives the integrated result.

## Business Bootstrap Sequence

Create `operations/BUSINESS_ACCESS.md` and `operations/business-access.json` during orient, before provider setup sprawls. Keep `currentPhase` visible and at most one structured `activeFounderGate` with phase, origin, class, definitions, choices, bypass/defer policy, lifecycle, next actions, and proof. Set the active gate to `null` while no founder decision is needed; the agent keeps working from `nextAgentAction`. Also record the next business operation so access setup cannot become a dead end. The first gate should be one combined step-away readiness choice. It must cover autonomy, budget, access, tools, upload roles, deployment targets, and optional final-release authority. Run the sequence continuously:

1. **Business identity:** confirm the working business/app name, founder-owned contact email, region, and whether a legal entity already exists. Do not force incorporation before it is needed.
2. **Ownership spine:** establish a founder-controlled business email, recovery email/phone, password-manager or passkey posture, and 2FA ownership. The founder remains the owner of record.
3. **Secret operations:** install or verify Doppler, authenticate the founder/operator locally, create or select the project and real configs, route secret names, and prove a safe injected command without printing values.
4. **Account inventory:** determine whether Apple, Google, domain/DNS, support email, X, Meta/Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, analytics, revenue, email, support, and deployment accounts exist.
5. **Create or claim:** use authenticated browser control to create or claim missing business assets when authorized. Explain platform verification, handle/name tradeoffs, and recovery implications before sticky identity changes.
6. **Delegate:** grant the narrowest revocable operator role or OAuth scope. Avoid shared personal logins.
7. **Verify:** read back the exact account, business asset, role, permissions, environment, recovery owner, and 2FA owner. Capture sanitized proof.
8. **Operate:** move into research, content, customer response, store, analytics, and launch work. Access setup is an unlock, not the deliverable.
9. **Stay unattended:** record the matching protected control waiver and exact workflow-scoped standing envelopes, then consume them without asking again. Combine any new missing permissions into one handoff and continue independent work.

### Plain-Language Research Example

Do not turn "prepare an interview for my friend" into an unexplained formal-research blocker. Define terms first: **compensation** means whether the person receives payment or a gift card; **recruitment** means how participants are found; a **moderator** is the person asking the questions. Then present one decision:

- **Phase:** Research-backed spec. **Outcome:** learn whether the problem and proposed product make sense to a real person.
- **Quick friend chat (Recommended):** prepare a 10-15 minute conversation guide now. Consequence: useful directional feedback, but not formal market proof; the agent drafts the guide and marks the evidence accordingly.
- **Formal interview:** add a clear purpose, voluntary participation, recording choice, note handling, participant criteria, and a structured script. Add compensation or recruitment only when people will actually be paid or sourced. Consequence: stronger research evidence, but more setup before the conversation.
- **Skip interviews for now:** synthesize existing sources and product evidence. Consequence: research remains partial and the choice returns before spec freeze.

The founder's request to prepare the friend conversation is authorization to prepare the reversible guide, not to spend money, recruit strangers, or claim formal validation. An unpaid informal chat that stores no sensitive data is not automatically a protected legal/privacy gate; apply stricter review only when the actual topic, population, claims, recording, or data handling requires it.

### The Consumer-Norm Evidence Bar

The example above generalizes. The evidence bar for a consumer app is consumer-app norms: store and competitor data, review mining, social language, keyword demand, and a live waitlist or purchase funnel. It is **not** research governance. Do not invent formative-interview programs gated behind privacy reviewers, external encrypted data planes, participant compensation approvals, or role-separated dry runs for a consumer utility — that apparatus produced zero customer proof in two months on a real launch before the founder retired it by hand. Escalate the bar only when a hard constraint forces it — medical or health claims, minors as a target audience, a regulated category — and even then propose the minimum that satisfies the constraint, as a founder decision with the cost stated.

## Doppler And Login Model

Refresh official Doppler docs and local CLI help before setup. Current source anchors:

- `https://docs.doppler.com/docs/cli`
- `https://docs.doppler.com/docs/service-tokens`

Use Doppler for API keys, OAuth/refresh tokens, webhook secrets, service tokens, CI/deploy credentials, store API credentials, and automation secrets. Keep only names, project/config locations, owners, and proof paths in the repo.

Use browser/password-manager/passkey/platform delegation for interactive human login. Do not treat Doppler as a browser-password autofill system. Never request a password, recovery code, 2FA code, passkey, cookie, or session token in chat or commit it to an artifact.

Default setup loop:

1. Check `doppler --version` and live help.
2. If login is missing, explain that the founder will complete the Doppler browser login; run `doppler login` only with their approval.
3. Confirm the active identity with `doppler me` without recording personal data beyond a safe account label. Verify that the workspace is founder-owned, recovery and MFA remain founder-controlled, and durable ready-state automation uses a named scoped delegated role, service token, OIDC route, or integration with an explicit revocation path. Founder-personal CLI login is bootstrap-only.
4. Create or select the business project and real configs through current CLI/dashboard flows. Never guess config names.
5. Run `doppler setup` in the correct repo scope.
6. Have the founder enter new values directly into Doppler or a secure provider prompt. The agent records secret names only.
7. Validate with `doppler run -- <safe smoke command>` that proves injection without echoing values.
8. Use config-scoped service tokens, provider integrations, or OIDC for CI/production. A personal CLI token is local-operator access only.

If the founder says "I can give you Doppler," translate that into the smallest secure action: authenticate the CLI or invite the appropriate business identity, then let the agent inventory projects/configs and do the rest. Never ask for a raw Doppler token in chat.

## Social Account Access

Track X, Meta/Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube explicitly even when deferred. Use the platform's current official role model and current browser UI; stored instructions may drift.

Preferred order:

1. Platform-native delegated role or business portfolio/member access.
2. OAuth connection to the approved operating tool with reviewed scopes.
3. Dedicated business-owned operator account with least privilege.
4. Founder-authenticated browser session when no delegation exists.
5. Shared credential only as an exceptional, documented platform limitation, stored in an approved password manager rather than chat/repo; founder retains recovery and 2FA. Token/service-account exceptions must record the delegation gap, scope source, rotation/expiry contract, secret name, limitations, and revocation path.

Current official source anchors:

- X Delegate: `https://help.x.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-use-the-delegate-feature`
- Meta Page/business access: `https://www.facebook.com/help/289207354498410?locale=en_GB`
- TikTok Business Center members: `https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/add-users-tiktok-business-center?lang=en`
- YouTube channel permissions: `https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9481328?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en-EN`

For every social account, verify:

- canonical handle/account and business asset
- founder owner-of-record
- operator identity and granted role
- explicit granted scopes for observe, draft, publish, reply, moderate, analytics, spend, identity change, and deletion; unavailable scopes remain false
- whether ads, billing, or finance permissions are excluded
- who delegated access and the exact revocation path
- recovery and 2FA owner
- connected OAuth/API secret names, never values
- a secret-scannable read-back log and the next operating action; route screenshots/video through `operations/AGENT_OPERATIONS.md` with its redaction attestation instead of treating a filename as proof of sanitization

Do not stop after saying "create an account." Offer handle options from the approved brand, check availability when authorized, open the correct signup/business screen, guide the founder through the single ownership step, complete profile setup, secure access, and move directly into the first content/research/support task.

## Authorization Boundaries

Account access and approval are separate records. Resolve both during onboarding when possible. Continue using `frontier-agent-operations.md` and its approval envelopes.

- Observe and draft autonomously inside the business scope.
- Connect accounts after the founder approves the exact account and role during the readiness setup.
- Publish, reply publicly, send broadcasts, spend, change pricing, alter legal/business identity, manage payment methods, submit stores, release, or delete only under the matching current approval envelope.
- Use a matching standing envelope without another confirmation.
- Website deployment, asset generation, store media/metadata, and test-build uploads should get both the required control waiver and standing envelopes during onboarding. Each envelope names exact catalog workflow IDs and exact output/provider resource prefixes; never record `workflow.*`.
- The founder owns final public voice policy until a standing voice envelope is recorded.
- Never widen a social role, OAuth scope, finance permission, or admin privilege merely to remove friction.

## Proof And Continuity

The durable source set is:

- `operations/BUSINESS_ACCESS.md`
- `operations/business-access.json`
- `operations/AGENT_OPERATIONS.md`
- `operations/agent-operations.json`
- `SECRETS.md`
- `state/PROJECT_STATE.yaml`
- `state/launch-cockpit.html`

After every setup action, update the exact account status and business asset, named operator identity, granted scopes, delegation and revocation path, next founder action, next agent action, next business operation, proof path, and blocker. `not_needed` requires a reason. At resume, continue from those next actions without asking the founder to reconstruct prior setup.

## Failure Conditions

Flag and repair these immediately:

- founder receives a jargon-heavy checklist or is asked "what do you want to do next?" while the agent has enough state to choose
- founder receives an invented blocker or a seven-field free-text questionnaire where a phase-labeled choice with a safe defer route would work
- agent stops after instructions instead of opening the setup surface and continuing
- password, 2FA, recovery code, cookie, raw token, or secret value is requested in chat
- Doppler is described as browser password storage or a raw personal token is requested
- a personal social login is shared when delegated access or OAuth exists
- a social account is called ready without exact handle, role, recovery/2FA ownership, sanitized proof, and an operating next step
- account access is treated as approval to publish, spend, reply, change identity, or delete
- the founder is interrupted for each account instead of receiving one consolidated readiness request
- a matching standing envelope exists but the agent asks for the same approval again
- the agent reaches deployment or store upload before checking required tools, roles, signing, and authentication
- the agent completes access setup but does not begin the next business operation
